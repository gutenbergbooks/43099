<h3>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</h3>

<p>This is the second volume of Biographia Epistolaris. The index
refers to both volumes. However, only those pages in the present volume
could be linked to their references. These include those in the
Appendix, but not in the Preface, which appeared in the first volume.</p>

<p>Volume 1 can be found at Project Gutenberg with the following address:</p>

<p>http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8210</p>

<p>There were a number of minor corrections made, which are described in
the <a href="#endnote">Notes</a> to be found at the end of this text.</p>

<p>As described in the end notes, ellipses occasionally are used
typographically to elide names. These have been converted to long dashes:
e.g., J&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Footnotes have been gathered at the end of the text, renumbered to be
unique, and have been linked for convenient access.</p>

<p>[Coleridge set sail from Portsmouth in the “Speedwell”
on 9th or 10th April 1804. He wrote to J. Tobin
on the 10th (<cite>Anima Poetae</cite>, p. 68):</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_130"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 130. To J. Tobin</span></h3>

<div class="dateline">April 10, 1804.</div>

<p>Men who habitually enjoy robust health have, too generally,
the trick, and a very cruel one it is, of imagining that
they discover the secret of all their acquaintances’ ill health in
some malpractice or other; and, sometimes, by gravely
asserting this, here, there, and everywhere (as who likes his
penetration hid under a bushel?), they not only do all they
can, without intending it, to deprive the poor sufferer of
that sympathy which is always a comfort and, in some
degree, a support to human nature, but, likewise, too often
implant serious alarm and uneasiness in the minds of the
person’s relatives and his nearest and dearest connections.
Indeed (but that I have known its inutility, that I should
be ridiculously sinning against my own law which I was
propounding, and that those who are most fond of advising
are the least able to hear advice from others, as the passion<a class="pagenum" id="Page_2" title="2"></a>
to command makes men disobedient) I should often have
been on the point of advising you against the two-fold rage
of advising and of discussing character, both the one and
the other of which infallibly generates presumption and
blindness to our own faults. Nay! more particularly where,
from whatever cause, there exists a slowness to understand
or an aptitude to mishear and consequently misunderstand
what has been said, it too often renders an otherwise truly
good man a mischief-maker to an extent of which he is but
little aware. Our friends’ reputation should be a religion to
us, and when it is lightly sacrificed to what self-adulation
calls a love of telling the truth (in reality a lust of talking
something seasoned with the cayenne and capsicum of
personality), depend upon it, something in the heart is
warped or warping, more or less according to the greater or
lesser power of the counteracting causes. I confess to you,
that being exceedingly low and heart-fallen, I should have
almost sunk under the operation of reproof and admonition
(the whole too, in my conviction, grounded on utter mistake)
at the moment I was quitting, perhaps for ever! my
dear country and all that makes it so dear&mdash;but the high
esteem which I cherish towards you, and my sense of your
integrity and the reality of your attachment and concern
blows upon me refreshingly as the sea-breeze on the tropic
islander. Show me anyone made better by blunt advice,
and I may abate of my dislike to it, but I have experienced
the good effects of the contrary in Wordsworth’s conduct
toward me; and, in Poole and others, have witnessed
enough of its ill-effects to be convinced that it does little
else but harm both to the adviser and the advisee.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="p2">There is some dubiety as to whether the J. Tobin to
whom the above letter was addressed is John Tobin, the
dramatist, or his brother James. But Coleridge had taken
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"></a>
up quarters with either of the brothers in London before
sailing for Malta (Dykes Campbell’s <cite>Life</cite>, p. 141); and
the letter is Coleridge’s parting shot for his host’s over
solicitous advice.</p>

<p>On 16th April he was off Oporto, and wrote a description
of the place, as seen from the sea, for Southey (<cite>Letters</cite>, 469).
The “Speedwell” was convoyed by the “Leviathan,” man-of-war
of 74 guns. Lisbon and the rest of the Portuguese
coast are described by Coleridge, and on 19th April the
“Speedwell” reached Gibraltar, where Coleridge landed
and scrambled on the rocks among the monkeys, “our
poor relations.” In his note-books he describes more fully
the scene around the Rock of Gibraltar with its multitude
and discordant complexity of associations&mdash;the Pillars of
Hercules, Calpe, and Abyla, the realms of Masinissa,
Jugurtha, and Syphax; Spain, Gibraltar, the Dey of Algiers,
dusky Moor, and black African. “At its feet mighty ramparts
establishing themselves in the sea, with their huge
artillery, hollow trunks of iron where Death and Thunder
sleep,” and “the abiding things of Nature, great, calm,
majestic, and one!” (<cite>Letters</cite>, pp. 478&ndash;9; <cite>Anima Poetae</cite>,
pp. 70, 74.)</p>

<p>In the voyage between Gibraltar and Malta they were
frequently in long dead calms&mdash;“every rope of the whole
ship reflected in the bright soft blue sea”&mdash;an <cite>Ancient
Mariner</cite> touch. They reached Valetta on 18th May, where
Coleridge was the guest of John Stoddart (afterwards Sir
John Stoddart), Attorney-General for Malta. Sir Alexander
Ball was then governor of the Island, and was greatly pleased
with Coleridge’s conversation and manners, and appointed
him his private secretary. The public secretary of the
Island dying suddenly in January 1805, Coleridge was made
interim Government secretary until the new nominee should
arrive. He held the office for eight months, from 18th
January to 6th September (<cite>Letters</cite>, 494); and he acquitted<a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" title="4"></a>
himself well as a business man in the post. What De Quincey
says to the contrary is a tissue of unfounded conjectures.
Dykes Campbell, one of Coleridge’s most painstaking biographers,
admits that there is nothing to show that Coleridge
did not perform the routine work of office well.</p>

<p>While in Malta Coleridge duly entered in his note-books
his impressions of his surroundings and he records his
dreamy introspections of the night watches (<cite>Anima Poetae</cite>).
But Coleridge did not spend all his time in Malta. Dykes
Campbell informs us that “early in August, the <em>demon of
restlessness</em> drove him to Sicily” (<cite>Life</cite>, p. 145), which may
be rather interpreted that the proximity of the land of
Theocritus was irresistible. He was away from the middle
of August to 7th November 1804. He twice ascended
Etna; and, although Dykes Campbell doubts his having
attained to the summit, according to his own account he
looked down the crater (Cottle’s <cite>Rem.</cite>, 318; Letter, No. 133).
Very few of Coleridge’s letters written in Malta are extant;
on account of the precariousness of the mode of despatch
in a time of war some of them never reached their destination.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1805 Coleridge was regretting that he
had accepted the Public Secretaryship, saying that his profits
would be much less than if he had employed his time and
efforts in his own literary pursuits (<cite>Letters</cite>, 491), another
way of grumbling against occupations inferior to the pursuit
of the Permanent. To Daniel Stuart he writes on 20th
April 1805: “In my letter, which will accompany this, I
have detailed my health and all that relates to me. In case,
however, that letter should not arrive, I will simply say,
that till within the last two months or ten weeks my health
had improved to the utmost of my hopes, though not without
some intrusion of sickness; but <em>latterly</em> the loss of my
letters to England, the almost entire non-arrival of letters
from England, not a single one from Mrs. Coleridge, or<a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" title="5"></a>
Southey, or you; and only one from the Wordsworths, and
that dated September 1804! my consequent heart-saddening
anxieties, and still, still more, the depths which Captain
John Wordsworth’s<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> death sunk into my heart, and which I
heard abruptly, and in the very painfullest way possible in a
public company&mdash;all these joined to my disappointment in
my expectation of returning to England by this convoy, and
the quantity and variety of my public occupations from
eight o’clock in the morning to five in the afternoon, having
besides the most anxious duty of writing public letters and
memorials which belongs to my talents rather than to my
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro-tempore</em> office; these and some other causes that I
cannot mention relative to my affairs in England, have produced
a sad change indeed on my health; but, however, I
hope all will be well. It is my present intention to return
home by Naples, Ancona, Trieste, etc., on or about the
second of next month” (<cite>Letters</cite>, 494&ndash;5). To his wife he
says, on 21 July 1805: “I have been hoping and expecting
to get away for England for five months past, and Mr.
Chapman<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> not arriving, Sir Alexander’s importunities have
always overpowered me, though my gloom has increased at
each disappointment. I am determined, however, to go in
less than a month. My office, as Public Secretary, the next
civil dignitary to the Governor, is a very, very busy one, and
not to involve myself in the responsibility of the Treasurer
I have but half the salary. I oftentimes subscribe my name
150 times a day&mdash;and administer half as many oaths&mdash;besides
which I have the public memorials to write, and, worse
than all, constant matters of irritation. Sir A. Ball is indeed
exceedingly kind to me” (<cite>Letters</cite>, 496&ndash;7).</p>

<p>Coleridge did not return by the proposed route of Naples,
Ancona, Trieste, to be continued, to avoid Napoleon’s
power, by Vienna, Berlin, Embden, and Denmark (<cite>Letters</cite>,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="6"></a>
492). He went, on the contrary, straight to Naples in
company with a gentleman unnamed (Dykes Campbell’s
<cite>Life</cite>, 149). Here he remained till the end of January
1806; and then proceeded to Rome, where he associated
with the artists resident in the Papal capital. He made the
acquaintance of Baron W. von Humboldt, then Prussian
Minister at the Papal Court; Ludwig Tieck, the German
translator of Shakespeare; Washington Allston, the best
American painter of his day; Canova, and Washington
Irving; (Flagg’s <cite>Life of Allston</cite>, 61).</p>

<p>Various accounts have been given about what Coleridge
said regarding his sojourn in Italy and his flight from it.
Gillman (179&ndash;181), Cottle (<cite>Rem.</cite>, 310&ndash;313), and Caroline
Fox (<cite>Journals</cite>), all differing as to particulars. Flagg, the
writer of the <cite>Life of Allston</cite>, says: “He had intended to go
by Switzerland and Germany, but being somewhat apprehensive
of danger on account of the movements of the
French troops, took the precautions to ask the advice of
Ambassador von Humboldt; he advised Coleridge to avoid
Bonaparte, who was meditating the seizure of his person,
and had already sent to Rome an order for his arrest, which
was withheld from execution by the connivance of the good
old Pope, Pius VII, who sent him a passport, and counselled
his immediate flight by way of Leghorn. Accordingly
he hastened to that port, where he found an American vessel
ready to sail for England, and embarked. On the voyage
they were chased by a French sail; the captain, becoming
alarmed, commanded Coleridge to throw his papers, including
his notes on Rome, overboard” (<cite>Life of Allston</cite>,
p. 61). This agrees substantially with what Coleridge says
in the <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite>, Chapter X. Cottle works the
matter up into a romance in his own facetious way; and
the other re-narrators mistake the facts somewhat. Caroline
Fox, for instance, locates the embarkation from Genoa,
saying: “On reaching Genoa, he so delighted an American<a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" title="7"></a>
by his conversation, who had never heard anything like it
since he left Niagara, that at all risks, and with many subtleties,
he got him on board, and brought him safe to
England” (<cite>Journals</cite>, I, 123).<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>]</p>

<p>[Coleridge reached England on 17th August 1806
(<cite>Letters</cite>, 499), and made for London, intending to
write articles once more for Daniel Stuart. He does not
seem, however, to have done anything at this time for the
newspapers.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Humphry Davy was endeavouring to get him to
give a course of lectures on the Fine Arts (Dykes Campbell’s
<cite>Life</cite>, 154). At the close of the year Coleridge was at Coleorton,
the seat of Sir George Beaumont in Leicestershire, where he
met William and Dorothy Wordsworth.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Wordsworth read
to him the <cite>Prelude</cite>, now completed; and Coleridge, after its
recital, wrote the well-known poem to Wordsworth in blank
verse, which is as much a dirge over his own failures as a
eulogy of Wordsworth’s poem. Wordsworth’s view of the
great men of all ages, forming an interconnected scheme of
truth slowly being revealed, is a Coleridgean rather than a
Wordsworthian idea (<cite>Prelude</cite>, Book XIII, 300&ndash;311); and
Coleridge in his verses to his brother bard hails him as
among the men of the Permanent, among the</p>

<p class="center">Choir of ever-during men.</p>

<p>On 17th February, Coleridge was still at Coleorton (Dykes
Campbell’s <cite>Life</cite>, 138); but in July, Coleridge and his wife and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="9"></a>
family were again at Stowey on a visit to Poole (<cite>T. Poole
and his Friends</cite>, ii, 175&ndash;182). Here Coleridge remained till
the end of September. Tom Wedgwood had died while he
was at Malta; and his brother Josiah expected Coleridge to
furnish him with some materials for a Life of Tom. Poole
endeavoured to impress upon him the necessity of complying;
but the task was distasteful to him, at which Josiah
Wedgwood, not unnaturally, was displeased.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But Coleridge,
after some procrastination, wrote to Josiah Wedgwood on
27th June 1807, giving reasons for his delay (Meteyard’s
<cite>Group of Englishmen</cite>, p. 324); and Wedgwood wrote to
Poole, “I was truly glad to hear from him. His letter removed
all those feelings of anger which occasionally, but
not permanently, existed in my mind towards him.” (<cite>T. Poole
and his Friends</cite>, ii, 185.)</p>

<p>Meantime, we find Coleridge again in correspondence
with Cottle, who had heard of his arrival in Stowey. Cottle
wrote to him, expressing the hope that Coleridge’s health
would soon allow him to pay a visit to Bristol (<cite>Rem.</cite>, 305).
To this Coleridge replied:</p>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash;&mdash; 1807.)</p>

<p>Dear Cottle,</p>

<p>On my return to Bristol, whenever that may be, I
will certainly give you the right hand of old fellowship; but,
alas! you will find me the wretched wreck of what you knew
me, rolling, rudderless. My health is extremely bad. Pain
I have enough of, but that is indeed to me, a mere trifle, but
the almost unceasing, overpowering sensations of wretchedness:
achings in my limbs, with an indescribable restlessness,
that makes action to any available purpose, almost impossible:
and worst of all, the sense of blighted utility, regrets,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" title="10"></a>
not remorseless. But enough; yea, more than enough; if
these things produce, or deepen the conviction of the utter
powerlessness of ourselves, and that we either perish, or find
aid from something that passes understanding.</p>

<div class="signature">

<p>Cottle tells us he knew nothing as yet of opium, and
was struck with the interesting narratives Coleridge gave
of his Italian experiences and of his voyage to England.
Theology was now in the ascendant with Coleridge who
had now abjured unitarianism and become more orthodox.
The following letters on the Trinity and kindred subjects
attest to the veracity of Cottle’s estimate of Coleridge at
this period (<cite>Reminiscences</cite>, 306, 325&ndash;6):</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_132"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 132. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(1807.)</p>

<p>* * * The declaration that the Deity is “the sole
Operant” (Religious Musings) is indeed far too bold; may
easily be misconstrued into Spinozism; and, therefore,
though it is susceptible of a pious and justifiable interpretation,
I should by no means now use such a phrase. I was
very young when I wrote that poem, and my religious feelings
were more settled than my theological notions.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_11" title="11"></a>As to eternal punishments, I can only say, that there are
many passages in Scripture, and these not metaphorical,
which declare that all flesh shall be finally saved; that the
word <em>aionios</em> is indeed used sometimes when eternity must
be meant, but so is the word “Ancient of Days,” yet it
would be strange reasoning to affirm, that therefore, the
word ancient must always mean eternal. The literal meaning
of <em>aionios</em> is, “through ages;” that is indefinite; beyond
the power of imagination to bound. But as to the effects of
such a doctrine, I say, First,&mdash;that it would be more pious
to assert nothing concerning it, one way or the other.</p>

<p>Ezra says well, “My Son, meditate on the rewards of the
righteous, and examine not over-curiously into the fate of
the wicked.”(This apocryphal Ezra is supposed to have been
written by some Christian in the first age of Christianity.)
Second,&mdash;that however the doctrine is now broached, and
publicly preached by a large and increasing sect, it is no
longer possible to conceal it from such persons as would
be likely to read and understand the <cite>Religious Musings</cite>.
Third.&mdash;That if the offers of eternal blessedness; if the love
of God; if gratitude; if the fear of punishment, unknown
indeed as to its kind and duration, but declared to be unimaginably
great; if the possibility, nay, the probability, that
this punishment may be followed by annihilation, not final
happiness, cannot divert men from wickedness to virtue; I
fear there will be no charm in the word Eternal.</p>

<p>Fourth, that it is a certain fact, that scarcely any believe
eternal punishment practically with relation to themselves.
They all hope in God’s mercy, till they make it a presumptuous
watch-word for religious indifference. And this, because
there is no medium in their faith, between blessedness
and misery,&mdash;infinite in degree and duration; which latter
they do not practically, and with their whole hearts, believe.
It is opposite to their clearest views of the divine attributes;
for God cannot be vindictive, neither therefore can his<a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="12"></a>
punishments be founded on a vindictive principle. They
must be, either for amendment, or warning for others; but
eternal punishment precludes the idea of amendment, and
its infliction, after the day of judgment, when all not so
punished shall be divinely secured from the possibility of
falling, renders the notion of warning to others inapplicable.</p>

<p>The Catholics are far more afraid of, and incomparably
more influenced in their conduct by, the doctrine of purgatory,
than Protestants by that of hell! That the Catholics
practise more superstitions than morals, is the effect of other
doctrines.&mdash;Supererogation; invocation of saints; power of
relics, etc., etc., and not of Purgatory, which can only act
as a general motive, to what must depend on other causes.</p>

<p>Fifth, and lastly.&mdash;It is a perilous state in which a Christian
stands, if he has gotten no further than to avoid evil
from the fear of hell! This is no part of the Christian religion,
but a preparatory awakening of the soul: a means of dispersing
those gross films which render the eye of the spirit incapable
of any religion, much less of such a faith as that of the
love of Christ.</p>

<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but
perfect love shutteth out fear. It is sufficient for the utmost
fervour of gratitude that we are saved from punishments,
too great to be conceived; but our salvation is surely not
complete, till by the illumination from above, we are made
to know “the exceeding sinfulness of sin,” and that horribleness
in its nature, which, while it involves all these frightful
consequences, is yet, of itself more affrightful to a regenerated
soul than those consequences. To him who but for a moment
felt the influence of God’s presence, the thought of eternal
exclusion from the sense of that presence, would be the
worst hell his imagination could conceive.</p>

<p>N.B. I admit of no right, no claim of a creature on its
Creator. I speak only of hopes and of faith deduced from
inevitable reason, the gift of the Creator; from his acknow<a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" title="13"></a>ledged
attributes. Above all, immortality is a free gift, which
we neither do, nor can deserve. * * *</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_133"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 133. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Bristol (June), 1807.</p>

<p>Dear Cottle,</p>

<p>To pursue our last conversation. Christians expect
no outward or sensible miracles from prayer. Its effects, and
its fruitions are spiritual, and accompanied says that <em>true
Divine</em>, Archbishop Leighton, “not by reasons and arguments,
but by an inexpressible kind of evidence, which they
only know who have it.”</p>

<p>To this I would add, that even those who, like me I fear,
have not attained it, yet may presume it. First, because
reason itself, or rather mere human nature, in any dispassionate
moment, feels the necessity of religion, but if this be
not true there is no religion, no religation, or binding over
again; nothing added to reason, and therefore <em>Socinianism</em>,
misnamed <em>Unitarianism</em>, is not only not <em>Christianity</em>, it is
not even <em>religion</em>, it does not <em>religate</em>; does not bind anew.
The first outward and sensible result of prayer is, a penitent
resolution, joined with a consciousness of weakness in effecting
it, yea even a dread, too well grounded, lest by breaking
and falsifying it, the soul should add guilt to guilt; by the
very means it has taken to escape from guilt; so pitiable is
the state of unregenerate man.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with Leighton’s Works? He resigned his
archbishoprick, and retired to voluntary poverty on account
of the persecutions of the Presbyterians, saying, “I should
not dare to introduce Christianity itself with such cruelties,
how much less for a surplice, and the name of a bishop.” If
there could be an intermediate space between inspired,
and uninspired writings, that space would be occupied by
Leighton. No show of learning, no appearance, or ostenta<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="14"></a>tious
display of eloquence, and yet both may be shown in
him, conspicuously and holily. There is in him something
that must be felt, even as the Scriptures must be felt.</p>

<p>You ask me my views of the <em>Trinity</em>. I accept the
doctrine, not as deduced from human reason, in its grovelling
capacity for comprehending spiritual things, but as the
clear revelation of Scripture. But perhaps it may be said,
the Socinians do not admit this doctrine as being taught in
the Bible. I know enough of their shifts and quibbles, with
their dexterity at explaining away all they dislike, and that
is not a little, but though beguiled once by them, I happily
for my own peace of mind, escaped from their sophistries,
and now hesitate not to affirm, that Socinians would lose all
character for honesty, if they were to explain their neighbour’s
will with the same latitude of interpretation, which they do
the Scriptures.</p>

<p>I have in my head some floating ideas on the <em>Logos</em>,
which I hope, hereafter, to mould into a consistent form;
but it is a gross perversion of the truth, in Socinians, to
declare that we believe in <em>three gods</em>; and they know it to be
false. They might, with equal justice affirm that we believe
in <em>three suns</em>. The meanest peasant, who has acquired the
first rudiments of Christianity, would shrink back from a
thing so monstrous. Still the Trinity has its difficulties. It
would be strange if otherwise. A <em>Revelation</em> that revealed
nothing, not within the grasp of human reason!&mdash;no religation,
no binding over again, as before said; but these difficulties
are shadows, contrasted with the substantive and insurmountable
obstacles, with which <em>they</em> contend who admit the
<em>Divine authority of Scripture</em>, with the <em>superlative excellence
of Christ</em>, and yet undertake to prove that these Scriptures
teach, and that Christ taught his own <em>pure humanity</em>.</p>

<p>If Jesus Christ was merely a man, if he was not God as
well as man, be it considered, he could not have been even
a <em>good man</em>. There is no medium. The <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> <em>in that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="15"></a>
case</em> was absolutely <em>a deceiver</em>! one, transcendantly <em>unrighteous</em>!
in advancing pretensions to miracles, by the
“Finger of God,” which he never performed; and by asserting
claims, (as a man) in the most aggravated sense, blasphemous.
These consequences, Socinians, to be consistent,
must allow, and which impious arrogation of Divinity in
Christ, according to their faith, as well as his false assumption
of a community of “glory” with the Father, “before the
world was,” even they will be necessitated completely to
admit the exoneration of the Jews,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> according to their law, in
crucifying one, who “being a man,” “made himself God!”
But in the Christian, rather than in the <em>Socinian</em>, or <em>Pharisaic</em>
view, all these objections vanish, and harmony succeeds to
inexplicable confusion. If Socinians hesitate in ascribing
<em>unrighteousness</em> to Christ, the inevitable result of their principles,
they tremble, as well they might, at their avowed
creed, and virtually renounce what they profess to uphold.</p>

<p>The Trinity, as Bishop Leighton has well remarked, is “a
doctrine of faith, not of demonstration,” except in a <em>moral</em>
sense. If the New Testament declare it, not in an insulated
passage, but through the whole breadth of its pages, rendering,
with any other admission, the book which is the Christian’s
anchor-hold of hope, dark and contradictory, then it is not
to be rejected, but on a penalty that reduces to an atom, all
the sufferings this earth can inflict.</p>

<p>Let the grand question be determined.&mdash;Is, or is not the
Bible <em>inspired</em>? No one book has ever been subjected to so
rigid an investigation as the Bible, by minds the most
capacious, and in the result, which has so triumphantly
repelled all the assaults of infidels. In the extensive intercourse
which I have had with this class of men, I have seen
their prejudices surpassed only by their ignorance. This I
found particularly the case in Dr. Darwin (Letter 19), the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="16"></a>
prince of their fraternity. Without therefore, stopping to
contend on what all dispassionate men must deem, undebatable
ground, I may assume inspiration as admitted; and,
equally so, that it would be an insult to man’s understanding,
to suppose any other Revelation from God than the
Christian Scriptures. If these Scriptures, impregnable in
their strength, sustained in their pretensions, by undeniable
prophecies and miracles, and by the experience of the <em>inner
man</em>, in all ages, as well as by a concatenation of arguments,
all bearing upon one point, and extending with miraculous
consistency, through a series of fifteen hundred years; if all
this combined proof does not establish their validity, nothing
can be proved under the sun; but the world and man must
be abandoned, with all its consequences, to one universal
scepticism! Under such sanctions, therefore, if these Scriptures,
as a fundamental truth, <em>do</em> inculcate the doctrine of
the <em>Trinity</em>; however surpassing human comprehension;
then I say, we are bound to admit it on the strength of
<em>moral demonstration</em>.</p>

<p>The supreme Governor of the world and the Father of
our spirits, has seen fit to disclose to us much of his will,
and the whole of his natural and moral perfections. In some
instances he has given his <em>word</em> only, and demanded our
<em>faith</em>; while on other momentous subjects, instead of bestowing
full revelation, like the <em>Via Lactea</em>, he has furnished a
glimpse only, through either the medium of inspiration, or
by the exercise of those rational faculties with which he has
endowed us. I consider the Trinity as substantially resting
on the first proposition, yet deriving support from the last.</p>

<p>I recollect when I stood on the summit of Etna, and
darted my gaze down the crater; the immediate vicinity was
discernible, till, lower down, obscurity gradually terminated
in total darkness. Such figures exemplify many truths revealed
in the Bible. We pursue them, until, from the imperfection
of our faculties, we are lost in impenetrable night.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="17"></a>
All truths, however, that are essential to faith, <em>honestly</em> interpreted;
all that are important to human conduct, under every
diversity of circumstance, are manifest as a blazing star. The
promises also of felicity to the righteous in the future world,
though the precise nature of that felicity may not be defined,
are illustrated by every image that can swell the imagination;
while the misery of the <em>lost</em>, in its unutterable intensity,
though the language that describes it is all necessarily
figurative, is there exhibited as resulting chiefly, if not
wholly, from the withdrawment of the <em>light of God’s countenance</em>,
and a banishment from his <em>presence</em>! best comprehended
in this world by reflecting on the desolations, which would
instantly follow the loss of the sun’s vivifying and universally
diffused <em>warmth</em>.</p>

<p>You, or rather <em>all</em>, should remember that some truths
from their nature, surpass the scope of man’s limited powers,
and stand as the criteria of <em>faith</em>, determining by their rejection,
or admission, who among the sons of men can confide
in the veracity of heaven. Those more ethereal truths, of
which the Trinity is conspicuously the chief, without being
circumstantially explained, may be faintly illustrated by
material objects. The eye of man cannot discern the satellites
of Jupiter, nor become sensible of the multitudinous
stars, whose rays have never reached our planet, and consequently
garnish not the canopy of night; yet are they the
less <em>real</em>, because their existence lies beyond man’s unassisted
gaze? The tube of the philosopher, and the <em>celestial telescope</em>,&mdash;the
unclouded visions of heaven will confirm the one class
of truths, and irradiate the other.</p>

<p>The <em>Trinity</em> is a subject on which analogical reasoning
may advantageously be admitted, as furnishing, at least, a
glimpse of light, and with this, for the present, we must be
satisfied. Infinite Wisdom deemed clearer manifestations
inexpedient; and is man to dictate to his Maker? I may
further remark, that where we cannot behold a desirable<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="18"></a>
object distinctly, we must take the best view we can; and I
think you, and every candid enquiring mind, may derive
assistance from such reflections as the following.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the arguments of Spinosa, and Des
Cartes, and other advocates of the <em>Material system</em>, or, in
more appropriate language, the <em>Atheistical system</em>! it is
admitted by all men, not prejudiced, not biased by sceptical
prepossessions, that <em>mind</em> is distinct from <em>matter</em>. The mind
of man, however, is involved in inscrutable darkness, (as the
profoundest metaphysicians well know) and is to be estimated,
if at all, alone by an inductive process; that is, by its
<em>effects</em>. Without entering on the question, whether an extremely
circumscribed portion of the mental process, surpassing
instinct, may or may not be extended to quadrupeds,
it is universally acknowledged, that the mind of man alone,
regulates all the actions<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of his corporeal frame. Mind,
therefore, may be regarded as a distinct genus, in the scale
ascending above brutes, and including the whole of intellectual
existences; advancing from <em>thought</em>, that mysterious
thing! in its lowest form, through all the gradations of
sentient and rational beings, till it arrives at a Bacon, a
Newton; and then, when unincumbered by matter, extending
its illimitable sway through Seraph and Archangel, till
we are lost in the <span class="smcap">Great Infinite</span>!</p>

<p>Is it not deserving of notice, as an especial subject of
meditation, that our <em>limbs</em>, in all they do or can accomplish,
implicitly obey the dictation of the <em>mind</em>? that this operating
power, whatever its name, under certain limitations, exercises
a sovereign dominion not only over our limbs, but over our<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
intellectual pursuits? The mind of every man is evidently
the fulcrum, the moving force, which alike regulates all his
limbs and actions: and in which example, we find a strong
illustration of the subordinate nature of mere <em>matter</em>. That<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19"></a>
alone which gives direction to the organic parts of our
nature, is wholly <em>mind</em>; and one mind if placed over a
thousand limbs, could, with undiminished ease, control and
regulate the whole.</p>

<p>This idea is advanced on the supposition that <em>one mind</em>
could command an unlimited direction over any given
number of <em>limbs</em>, provided they were all connected by <em>joint</em>
and <em>sinew</em>. But suppose, through some occult and inconceivable
means, these limbs were dis-associated, as to all
material connexion; suppose, for instance, one mind with
unlimited authority, governed the operations of <em>two</em> separate
persons, would not this substantially, be only <em>one person</em>,
seeing the directing principle was one? If the truth here
contended for, be admitted, that <em>two persons</em>, governed by
<em>one mind</em>, is incontestably <em>one person</em>; the same conclusion
would be arrived at, and the proposition equally be justified,
which affirmed that, <em>three</em>, or otherwise <em>four</em> persons, owning
also necessary and essential subjection to <em>one mind</em>, would
only be so many diversities or modifications of that <em>one mind</em>,
and therefore the component parts virtually collapsing into
<em>one whole</em>, the person would be <em>one</em>. Let any man ask himself,
whose understanding can both reason and become the
depository of truth, whether, if <em>one mind</em> thus regulated with
absolute authority, <em>three</em>, or otherwise <em>four</em> persons, with all
their congeries of material parts, would not these parts inert
in themselves, when subjected to one predominant mind, be
in the most logical sense, <em>one person</em>? Are ligament and
exterior combination indispensable pre-requisites to the
sovereign influence of mind over mind? or mind over matter?</p>

<p>But perhaps it may be said, we have no instance of one
mind governing more than one body. This may be, but the
argument remains the same. With a proud spirit, that forgets
its own contracted range of thought, and circumscribed
knowledge, who is to limit the sway of Omnipotence? or<a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" title="20"></a>
presumptuously to deny the possibility of <em>that</em> Being, who
called light out of darkness, so to exalt the dominion of <em>one
mind</em>, as to give it absolute sway over other dependant
minds, or (indifferently) over detached, or combined portions
of organized matter? But if this superinduced quality be
conferable on any order of created beings, it is blasphemy
to limit the power of God, and to deny <em>his</em> capacity to
transfuse <em>his own</em> Spirit, when and to whom he will.</p>

<p>This reasoning may now be applied in illustration of the
Trinity. We are too much in the habit of viewing our
Saviour Jesus Christ, through the medium of his body. “A
body was prepared for him,” but this body was mere matter;
as insensible in itself as every human frame when deserted
by the soul. If therefore the Spirit that was in Christ, was
the Spirit of the Father; if no thought, no vibration, no
spiritual communication, or miraculous display, existed in,
or proceeded from Christ, not immediately and consubstantially
identified with Jehovah, the Great First cause; if
all these operating principles were thus derived, in consistency
alone with the conjoint divine attributes; if this Spirit of the
Father ruled and reigned in Christ as his own manifestation,
then in the strictest sense, Christ exhibited “the Godhead
bodily,” and was undeniably “<em>one</em> with the Father;” confirmatory
of the Saviour’s words: “Of myself,” (my body) “I
can do nothing, the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth
the works.”</p>

<p>But though I speak of the body as inert in itself, and
necessarily allied to matter, yet this declaration must not be
understood as militating against the Christian doctrine of the
<em>resurrection of the body</em>. In its grosser form, the thought is
not to be admitted, for “flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God,” but, that the body, without losing its consciousness
and individuality, may be subjected by the illimitable
power of Omnipotence, to a sublimating process, so as
to be rendered compatible with spiritual association, is not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="21"></a>
opposed to reason, in its severe abstract exercises, while in
attestation of this <em>exhilarating belief</em>, there are many remote
analogies in nature exemplifying the same truth, while it is
in the strictest accordance with that final dispensation, which
must, as Christians, regulate all our speculations. I proceed
now to say, that</p>

<p>If the postulate be thus admitted, that one mind influencing
two bodies, would only involve a diversity of operations,
but in reality be one in essence; or otherwise (as an hypothetical
argument, illustrative of truth), if one pre-eminent
mind, or spiritual subsistence, unconnected with matter,
possessed an undivided and sovereign dominion over two or
more disembodied minds, so as to become the exclusive
source of all their subtlest volitions and exercises, the <em>unity</em>,
however complex the modus of its manifestation, would be
fully established; and this principle extends to Deity itself,
and shows the true sense, as I conceive, in which Christ and
the Father are one.</p>

<p>In continuation of this reasoning, if God who is light, the
Sun of the Moral World, should in his union of Infinite
Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, and from all Eternity, have
ordained that an emanation from himself,&mdash;for aught we
know, an essential emanation, as light is inseparable from
the luminary of day&mdash;should not only have existed in his
Son, in the fulness of time to be united to a mortal body,
but that a like emanation from himself (also perhaps essential)
should have constituted the Holy Spirit, who, without losing
his ubiquity, was more especially sent to this lower earth, <em>by</em>
the Son, <em>at</em> the impulse of the Father, then in the most comprehensive
sense, God, and his Son, Jesus Christ, and the
Holy Ghost, are <span class="smcap">one</span>. “Three persons in one God,” and
thus form the true Trinity in Unity.</p>

<p>To suppose that more than <span class="smcap">one</span> Independent Power, or
Governing mind exists in the whole universe, is absolute
Polytheism, against which the denunciations of all the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="22"></a>
Jewish and Christian canonical books were directed. And if
there be but <span class="smcap">one</span> directing <span class="smcap">mind</span>, that Mind is God! operating
however, in Three Persons, according to the direct and
uniform declarations of that inspiration which “brought life
and immortality to light.” Yet this divine doctrine of the
Trinity is to be received, not because it is or can be clear to
finite apprehension, but (in reiteration of the argument)
because the Scriptures, in their unsophisticated interpretation
expressly state it. The Trinity, therefore, from its
important aspects, and Biblical prominence, is the grand
article of faith, and the foundation of the whole Christian
system.</p>

<p>Who can say, as Christ and the Holy Ghost proceeded
from, and are still one with the Father, and as all the
disciples of Christ derive their fulness from him, and, in
spirit, are inviolately united to him as a branch is to the
vine, who can say, but that in one view, what was once
mysteriously separated, may as mysteriously, be re-combined,
and (without interfering with the everlasting Trinity, and the
individuality of the spiritual and seraphic orders) the Son, at
the consummation of all things, deliver up his mediatorial
kingdom to the Father, and God, in some peculiar and infinitely
sublime sense, become All in All! God love you,</p>

<div class="dateline">Saturday afternoon.<br />
(1807.)</div>

<p>My dear young friend,</p>

<p>I am sorry that you should have felt any delicacy in
disclosing to me your religious feelings, as rendering it in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="23"></a>consistent
with your tranquillity of mind to spend the
Sunday evening with me. Though I do not find in that
book, which we both equally revere, any command, either
express, or which I can infer, which leads me to attach any
criminality to cheerful and innocent social intercourse on the
Lord’s day; though I do not find that it was in the least
degree forbidden to the Jews on their Sabbath; and though
I have been taught by Luther, and the great founders of the
Church of England, that the Sabbath was a part of the
ceremonial and transitory parts of the law given by heaven
to Moses; and that our Sunday is binding on our consciences,
chiefly from its manifest and most awful usefulness,
and indeed moral necessity; yet I highly commend your
firmness in what you think right, and assure you solemnly,
that I esteem you greatly for it. I would much rather that
you should have too much, than an atom too little. I am
far from surprised that, having seen what you have seen, and
suffered what you have suffered, you should have opened
your soul to a sense of our fallen nature; and the incapability
of man to heal himself. My opinions may not be in all
points the same as yours; but I have experienced a similar
alteration. I was for many years a Socinian; and at times
almost a Naturalist, but sorrow, and ill health, and disappointment
in the only deep wish I had ever cherished,
forced me to look into myself; I read the New Testament
again, and I became fully convinced, that Socinianism was
not only not the doctrine of the New Testament, but that it
scarcely deserved the name of a religion in any sense. An
extract from a letter which I wrote a few months ago to a
sceptical friend, who had been a Socinian, and of course
rested all the evidences of Christianity on miracles, to the
exclusion of grace and inward faith, will perhaps, surprise
you, as showing you how much nearer our opinions are
than what you must have supposed. “I fear that the mode
of defending Christianity, adopted by Grotius first; and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="24"></a>
latterly, among many others, by Dr. Paley, has increased
the number of infidels;&mdash;never could it have been so great,
if thinking men had been habitually led to look into their
own souls, instead of always looking out, both of themselves,
and of their nature. If to curb attack, such as yours on
miracles, it had been answered:&mdash;‘Well, brother! but granting
these miracles to have been in part the growth of delusion
at the time, and of exaggeration afterward, yet still all the
doctrines will remain untouched by this circumstance, and
binding on thee. Still must thou repent and be regenerated,
and be crucified to the flesh; and this not by thy own mere
power; but by a mysterious action of the moral Governor on
thee; of the Ordo-ordinians, the Logos, or Word. Still will
the eternal filiation, or Sonship of the Word from the
Father; still will the Trinity of the Deity, the redemption,
and the thereto necessary assumption of humanity by the
Word, “who is with God, and is God,” remain truths: and
still will the vital head-and-heart <span class="smcap">faith</span> in these truths, be
the living and only fountain of all true virtue. Believe all
these, and with the grace of the Spirit consult your own
heart, in quietness and humility, they will furnish you with
proofs, that surpass all understanding, because they are felt
and known; believe all these I say, so as that thy faith shall
be not merely real in the acquiescence of the intellect; but
actual, in the thereto assimilated affections; then shall thou
<span class="smcap">know</span> from God, whether or not Christ be of God. But take
notice, I only say, the miracles are extra essential; I by no
means deny their importance, much less hold them useless,
or superfluous. Even as Christ did, so would I teach; that
is, build the miracle on the faith, not the faith on the
miracle.’</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_135"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 135. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(1807.)</p>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>* * * The common end of all narrative, nay, of all
poems is, to convert a series into a whole, to make those
events, which, in real or imagined history, move on in a
straight line, assume to our understandings a circular motion&mdash;the
snake with its tail in its mouth. Hence, indeed, the
almost flattering and yet appropriate term, Poesy, <em>i.e.</em> Poieses&mdash;<em>making</em>.
Doubtless, to His eye, which alone comprehends
all past and all future, in one eternal, what to our short sight
appears straight, is but a part of the great cycle, just as the
calm sea to us appears level, though it be indeed only a part
of the globe. Now what the globe is in geography, miniaturing
in order to manifest the truth, such is a poem to that
image of God, which we were created into, and which still
seeking that unity, or revelation of the one, in and by the
many, which reminds it, that though in order to be an
individual being, it must go further from God; yet as the
receding from him, is to proceed toward nothingness and
privation, it must still at every step turn back toward him,
in order to be at all. A straight line continually retracted,
forms of necessity a circular orbit. Now God’s will and word
<span class="smcap">cannot</span> be frustrated. His fiat was, with ineffable awfulness,
applied to man, when all things, and all living things, and
man himself, (as a mere animal) included, were called forth
by the Universal, “Let there be,” and then the breath of the
Eternal superadded, to make an immortal spirit&mdash;immortality
being, as the author of the <cite>Wisdom of Solomon</cite> profoundly
expresses it, “the only possible reflex, or image of
eternity.” The immortal finite is the contracted shadow of
the eternal Infinite. Therefore nothingness, or death, to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="26"></a>
which we move, as we recede from God and from the Word,
cannot be nothing; but that tremendous medium between
nothing and true being, which Scripture and inmost reason
present as most, most horrible!.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="27"></a><a id="CHAP_XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<span class="subtitle">DE QUINCEY</span></h2>

<p>[Cottle tells us that in the spring of 1807 a lady of his
acquaintance introduced to him a Mr. De Quincey.
On the 26th July, Cottle wrote to Poole (<cite>T. Poole and his
Friends</cite>, ii, 190) a note of introduction and sent it with “the
bearer Mr. De Quincey, a Gentleman of Oxford, a scholar
and a man of genius.” Coleridge had gone to Bridgwater on
a visit to a friend, Mr. Chubb; but Poole entertained De
Quincey and invited him to stay till Coleridge should
return. De Quincey, however, preferred to go in quest of
the poet, and proceeded to Bridgwater and there found
Coleridge as he has depicted him in his description already
given in Chapter IV.</p>

<p>Afterwards De Quincey made enquiries of Cottle concerning
the pecuniary affairs of Coleridge, and asked Cottle
if he thought Coleridge would accept a gift of one or two
hundred pounds (<cite>Rem.</cite>, 340&ndash;341). Cottle informs us that
he enquired personally of Coleridge regarding his monetary
circumstances, and then told him that “a young man of
fortune, who admired his talents,” wished to present him
with a hundred or two hundred pounds. The <cite>De Quincey
Memorials</cite> gives a somewhat different account of this transaction
in which Cottle first divulged the generous purpose
of De Quincey by letter (<cite>De Quincey Memorials</cite>, i, 127&ndash;130).
Doubtless Cottle had forgotten his letter, and, writing thirty
years after the event, recollected only the conversation with
Coleridge intervening between the date of his letter and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28"></a>
another to De Quincey, dated 7th October. In the P.S. of
the letter to De Quincey Cottle says, “I have no doubt but
that Coleridge has suffered exceedingly from straits. I am
sure he is the greatest genius breathing; and that such a
mind should be perplexed about mutton and pudding and
waistcoats and hose for himself and children is piteous and
afflicting. These things paralyse his efforts. Under favourable
auspices, what gigantic effort would be too mighty for
him? Oct. 7, 1807.”</p>

<p>Cottle further states that De Quincey ultimately wished
to give £500; but that he urged De Quincey to make it
only £300 in the meantime, to be afterwards increased, if
need be, to £500.</p>

<p>Coleridge, in answer to Cottle, wrote the following letter
which must be of even date with his letter to De Quincey.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_136"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 136. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(7 Oct. 1807.)</p>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>Independent of letter-writing, and a dinner engagement
with C. Danvers, I was the whole of yesterday till
evening, in a most wretched restlessness of body and limbs,
having imprudently discontinued some medicines, which are
now my anchor of hope. This morning I dedicate to certain
distant calls on Dr. Beddoes and Colston, at Clifton,
not so much for the calls themselves, as for the necessity of
taking brisk exercise.</p>

<p>But no unforeseen accident intervening, I shall spend the
evening with you from seven o’clock.</p>

<p>I will now express my sentiments on the important subject
communicated to you. I need not say it has been the
cause of serious meditation. Undoubtedly, calamities have
so thickened on me for the last two years, that the pecuniary
pressures of the moment, are the only serious obstacles at<a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" title="29"></a>
present to my completion of those works, which, if completed,
would make me easy. Besides these, I have reason
for belief that a Tragedy of mine will be brought on the
stage this season, the result of which is of course only one
of the possibilities of life, on which I am not fool enough to
calculate.</p>

<p>Finally therefore, if you know that any unknown benefactor
is in such circumstances, that, in doing what he offers
to do, he transgresses no duty of morals, or of moral prudence,
and does not do that from feeling which after reflection
might perhaps discountenance, I shall gratefully accept
it, as an unconditional loan, which I trust I shall be able to
restore at the close of two years. This however, I shall be
able to know at the expiration of one year, and shall then
beg to know the name of my benefactor, which I should
then only feel delight in knowing, when I could present to
him some substantial proof, that I have employed the tranquillity
of mind, which his kindness has enabled me to
enjoy, in sincere desires to benefit my fellow men. May
God bless you.</p>

<p>The Tragedy here spoken of may have been a re-cast of
<cite>Osorio</cite> or a projected play entitled <cite>The Triumph of Loyalty</cite>,
of which one act was written, and of which the <cite>Night Scene</cite>,
attributed to 1801, is a fragment.</p>

<p>The full account of De Quincey’s meeting, and description
of Coleridge, is found in De Quincey’s <cite>Works</cite>, edited by
Professor Masson, vol. ii, 139&ndash;164, 214&ndash;225. His dictum on
Coleridge has been often quoted: “He is the largest and
most spacious intellect, the subtlest and most comprehensive
that has yet existed among men.”]</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="30"></a><a id="CHAP_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="subtitle">FIRST LECTURES</span></h2>

<p>[In August 1807 we find Humphry Davy writing to Poole
that he had been corresponding with Coleridge urging
him to undertake a course of Lectures at the Royal Institution,
London, whither Davy had gone after leaving the Pneumatic
Institute of Dr. Beddoes. Coleridge did not show
alacrity in answering, one of the reasons being doubtless the
attitude of his friend Tom Poole, who did not approve of
Coleridge wasting his abilities in lecturing, even on Shakespeare.
Southey, too, corroborated. When he heard that
Coleridge was engaging to give lectures at the Royal Institution
he wrote: “From this I shall endeavour to dissuade
him, if it be not too late, because it will detain him from
what is of greater immediate importance; because he will
never be ready, and therefore always on the fret; and
because I think his prospects such that it is not prudent to
give lectures to ladies and gentlemen in Albemarle Street,&mdash;Sidney
Smith is good enough for them.” (<cite>T. Poole and his
Friends</cite>, ii, 177&ndash;8.)</p>

<p>At last Coleridge replied to Davy in a hesitating state of
mind:</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_137"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 137. To Davy</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">September 11, 1807.</p>

<p>* * * Yet how very few are there whom I esteem, and
(pardon me from this seeming deviation from the language<a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" title="31"></a>
of friendship) admire equally with yourself. It is indeed,
and has long been, my settled persuasion, that of all men
known to me, I could not justly equal any one to you, combining
in one view powers of intellect, and the steady moral
exertion of them to the production of direct and indirect
good; and if I give you pain, my heart bears witness that I
inflicted a greater on myself,&mdash;nor should have written such
words (alluding to expression of feeling respecting himself
in the opening portion of the letter), if the chief feeling that
mixed with and followed them, had not been that of shame
and self-reproach, for having profited neither by your general
example, nor your frequent and immediate incentives.
Neither would I have oppressed you at all with this melancholy
statement, but that for some days past, I have found
myself so much better in body and mind, as to cheer
me at times with the thought that this most morbid and
oppressive weight is gradually lifting up, and my will acquiring
some degree of strength and power of reaction.</p>

<p class="center">*

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I have, however, received such manifest benefit from
horse exercise, and gradual abandonment of fermented and
total abstinence from spirituous liquors, and by being alone
with Poole, and the renewal of old times, by wandering
about among my dear old walks of Quantock and Alfoxden,
that I have seriously set about composition, with a view to
ascertain whether I can conscientiously undertake what I so
very much wish, a series of Lectures at the Royal Institution.
I trust, I need not assure you, how much I feel your
kindness, and let me add, that I consider the application as
an act of great and unmerited condescension on the part of
the managers as may have consented to it. After having
discussed the subject with Poole, he entirely agrees with me,
that the former plan suggested by me is invidious in itself,
unless I disguised my real opinions; as far as I should
deliver my sentiments respecting the <em>arts</em>, would require<a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="32"></a>
references and illustrations not suitable to a public lecture
room; and, finally, that I ought not to reckon upon spirits
enough to seek about for books of Italian prints, etc. And
that after all the general and most philosophical principles,
I might naturally introduce into lectures on a more confined
plan&mdash;namely, the principles of poetry, conveyed and illustrated
in a series of lectures. 1. On the genius and writings
of Shakespeare, relatively to his predecessors and contemporaries,
so as to determine not only his merits and defects,
and the proportion that each must bear to the whole, but
what of his merits and defects belong to his age, as being
found in contemporaries of genius, and what belonged to
himself. 2. On Spenser, including the metrical romances,
and Chaucer, though the character of the latter as a manner-painter,
I shall have so far anticipated in distinguishing it
from, and comparing it with, Shakespeare. 3. Milton.
4. Dryden and Pope, including the origin and after history
of poetry of witty logic. 5. On Modern Poetry, and its
characteristics, with no introduction of any particular names.
In the course of these I shall have said all I know, the
whole result of many years’ continued reflection on the subjects
of taste, imagination, fancy, passion, the source of our
pleasures in the fine arts, in the <em>antithetical</em> balance-loving
nature of man, and the connexion of such pleasures with
moral excellence. The advantage of this plan to myself is&mdash;that
I have all my materials ready, and can rapidly reduce
them into form (for this is my solemn determination, not to
give a single lecture till I have in fair writing at least one
half of the whole course), for as to trusting anything to immediate
effect, I shrink from it as from guilt, and guilt in me
it would be.</p>

<p>In short, I should have no objection at once to pledge
myself to the immediate preparation of these lectures, but
that I am so surrounded by embarrassments.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="33"></a>For God’s sake enter into my true motive for this wearing<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
detail: it would torture me if it had any other effect than to
impress on you my desire and hope to accord with your
plan, and my incapability of making any final promise till
the end of this month.</p>

<div class="signature">
 <span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
</div>

<p class="p2">In spite of Poole and Southey’s objections a course of
Lectures was at last arranged. Poole, writing to Davy
in January 1808, informs him that their mutual friend
Purkis had heard one of the lectures and speaks highly of
it and its effect. “I heretofore thought Coleridge,” says
Poole, “might employ himself in something more permanently
important than lecturing on such subjects as he would
lecture on at the Royal Institution. But from my more
intimate knowledge of his present state and habits, I am
now convinced that he <em>cannot</em> exert himself to better purpose;
and further, that nothing whatever is more likely to
stimulate him to exert his matchless powers (so is he constituted,
and so morbid feelings oppress him) than in reading
his productions to such an audience,” (<cite>T. Poole and his
Friends</cite>, ii, 205).</p>

<p>The Lectures were delivered between 12th January and
June 1808. Charles Lamb, in a letter to his friend Manning,
on 26th February 1808, says: “Coleridge has delivered two
lectures at the Royal Institution; two more attended but he
did not come. It is thought he has gone sick upon them”
(<cite>Ainger</cite>, i, 246). Wordsworth, hearing of Coleridge’s illness,
came to town in April, and he reported to Sir George
Beaumont that he had heard Coleridge lecture twice, and
that he seemed to give great satisfaction, although he was
not in spirits and suffered much during the course of the
week in body and mind (Knight’s <cite>Life of Wordsworth</cite>, ii, 114).</p>

Albemarle Street, and dismissal after dismissal of audiences

more in the work of that supreme master of imaginative
biography, is perhaps exaggerated. Coleridge disappointed
his audience only twice, on account of illness.</p>

<p>Besides the evidence of Lamb and Purkis and Wordsworth,
regarding the success of the lectures, Henry Crabb
Robinson gives some short notices of them. He heard at
least four of the course. The second Lecture, delivered on
5th February, he reports to have been largely taken up with
discoursing on the origin of the Greek mythology and Greek
drama, and in showing that the Modern Drama, like the
Ancient, originated in Religion. The character of Hamlet
was also treated of. The lectures were much in substance
similar to the course afterwards given in 1811, in which
Coleridge more fully developed his views.</p>

<p>In one of his lectures Coleridge made an attack on
Lancaster, the founder of the method of education which
went under his name, which caused some recrimination on
the part of the adherents of Lancaster. Coleridge about
this time had, through the Wordsworths, become acquainted
with Dr. Andrew Bell, the originator of the Madras system
of education, and he spoke as the champion of Bell against
Lancaster in the controversy that ensued between the partisans
of the two. Bell seemingly, from the evidence of
Coleridge’s letters, expostulated with Coleridge for his
having too warmly espoused his cause. Of the four letters
written to Dr. Bell at this time (Southey’s <cite>Life of Bell</cite>, II,
575&ndash;584), we give the first. The others are of little importance.
The dates of the three others are: II, April 1808;
III, 17th May 1808, in which Coleridge asserts that he is
“a convinced and fervent son of the Church of England”;
and IV, May, 1808. The first letter relates to the <cite>Elements
of Tuition</cite>, which Dorothy Wordsworth had been revising<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="35"></a>
for Dr. Bell, and was also submitted to Coleridge for his
opinion.</p>

<p>A concurrence of intelligence from my friends in the
North, has not only made it difficult for me to force my
mind away from dreaming about them, but has employed
me in running about after my friends day after day; yet
even this would not have prevented my commencing (according
to my judgment, which, on such a work, is but
another word for my feelings) on the sheets you have sent
me, if I had seen aught which appeared to me likely to
diminish its <em>present utility</em>. I confess that I seem to perceive
some little of an effort produced by talking with <em>objectors</em>,
with men who, to a man like you, are far, far more pernicious
than avowed antagonists. Men who are actuated
by fear and perpetual suspicion of human nature, and who
regard their poorer brethren as possible highwaymen, burglarists,
or Parisian revolutionists (which includes all evil
in one), and who, if God gave them grace to know their
own hearts, would find that even the little good they are
willing to assist proceeds from fear, from a momentary
variation of the balance of probabilities, which happened to
be in favour of letting their brethren know just enough to
keep them from the gallows. O dear Dr. Bell, you are a
great man! Never, never permit minds so inferior to your
own, however high their artificial rank may be, to induce
you to pare away <em>an atom</em> of what you know to be right!
The sin that besets a truly good man is, that, naturally
desiring to see instantly done what he knows will be
eminently useful to his fellow beings, he sometimes will<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="36"></a>
consent to sacrifice a part, in order to realize, in a given spot
(to construct, as the mathematicians say), his idea in a given
diagram. But yours is for the world&mdash;for all mankind; and all
your opposers might, with as good chance of success, stop
the half-moon from becoming full&mdash;all they can do is, a
little to retard it. Pardon, dear sir, a great liberty taken
with you, but one which my heart and sincere reverence for
you impelled&mdash;as the Apostle said, Rejoice!&mdash;so I say to
you <em>Hope</em>! From hope, faith and love, all that is good, all
that is great, all lovely and “all honourable things,” proceed,
from fear, distrust and the spirit of compromise&mdash;all that is
evil. You and Thomas Clarkson have, in addition to your
<em>material</em> good works, given to the spiritual world a benefaction
of incalculable value. You have both&mdash;he in removing
the evil, you in producing good&mdash;afforded a practicable
proof how great things one good man may do, who is
thoroughly in earnest.</p>

<p class="center">May the Almighty preserve you!</p>

<p>P.S. If, in the course of a few days, you could send me
the same, or another copy of, the sheets I now send you,
they would be useful to me in composing my lecture on the
subject. Sir G. and Lady Beaumont are very desirous to see
and consult you about a school at Dunmow. Be assured,
while I have life and power, I shall find a deep consolation
in being your zealous apostle. I write in a great hurry,
scarce knowing what I write; but before a future edition, I
will play the minute critic with you, and regard your book
as a literary work for posterity.</p>

<p>About this time Coleridge met his old sweetheart, Mary
Evans; and, in answer to an invitation to call upon her and
her husband, Mr. Todd, he wrote: “Undoubtedly the first
moment of the feeling was an awful one to me, the <em>second</em>
of time previous to my full recognition of you, the Mary<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" title="37"></a>
Evans of 14 years ago, flashed across my eyes with a truth
and vividness as great as its rapidity.” The full letter, which
is undated, but must be of 1804&ndash;8, was communicated to the
<cite>Athenæum</cite> of 18 May 1895, by her granddaughter, Mrs.
Linde, of Wiesbaden.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE FRIEND</span></h2>

<p>[During the Spring of 1808, Coleridge, while delivering
his lectures, had some correspondence with
Matilda Betham between March and July. Matilda Betham
was a portrait painter, and Coleridge had consented to sit
for her. The letters to Matilda Betham are probably dated
thus: I, (March) 1808; II, 4th April 1808; III, (April
1808); IV, 7th May 1808; V, (&mdash;&mdash; 1808). <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite>,
1878.</p>

<p>After paying a visit to the Clarkson’s, at Bury St. Edmunds,
Coleridge went back to Grasmere and lived with the Wordsworths,
now at Allan Bank. Coleridge felt that lecturing
was not a permanent form of employment, and now projected
a journal to disseminate what he called the Permanent
Principles of Politics, Morality, and Religion. In a letter
written about this time to his old friend Josiah Wade, he
repudiates the accusation that he had lived to little purpose.</p>

<p>My best and dearest friend,</p>

<p>I have barely time to scribble a few lines, so as not
to miss the post, for here as every where, there are charitable
people, who, taking for granted that you have no business of
your own, would save from the pain of vacancy, by employing
you in theirs.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="39"></a></p>

<p>As to the letter you propose to write to a man who is
unworthy even of a rebuke from you, I might most unfeignedly
object to some parts of it, from a pang of conscience
forbidding me to allow, even from a dear friend, words of
admiration, which are inapplicable in exact proportion to
the power given to me of having deserved them, if I had
done my duty.</p>

<p>It is not of comparative utility I speak: for as to what
has been actually done, and in relation to useful effects
produced, whether on the minds of individuals, or of the
public, I dare boldly stand forward, and (let every man
have his own, and that be counted mine which, but for, and
through me, would not have existed) will challenge the
proudest of my literary contemporaries to compare proofs
with me, of usefulness in the excitement of reflection, and
the diffusion of original or forgotten, yet necessary and
important truths and knowledge; and this is not the less
true, because I have suffered others to reap all the advantages.
But, O dear friend, this consciousness, raised by
insult of enemies, and alienated friends, stands me in little
stead to my own soul, in how little then, before the all-righteous
Judge! who, requiring back the talents he had
entrusted, will, if the mercies of Christ do not intervene,
not demand of me what I have done, but why I did not do
more; why, with powers above so many, I had sunk in many
things below most! But this is too painful, and in remorse
we often waste the energy which should be better employed
in reformation&mdash;that essential part, and only possible proof,
of sincere repentance. * * *</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="40"></a><a id="LETTER_140"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 140. To Davy</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Grasmere, Kendal, Wednesday, December, 1808.</p>

<p>My dear Davy,</p>

<p>* * * My health and spirits are improved beyond
my boldest hopes. A very painful effort of moral courage
has been remunerated by tranquillity&mdash;by ease from the
sting of self-disapprobation. I have done more for the last
ten weeks than I had done for three years before. Among
other things, I wrote what the few persons who saw it
thought a spirited and close reasoned letter to Mr. Jeffery,
respecting the introductory paragraph of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
review of your paper; but I was earnestly dissuaded from
sending it, as from an act of undeserved respect&mdash;as from
too great a condescension even on my part; and secondly
(and which was of more weight with me), as an act involving
you more or less, whatever I might say, and likely to be
attributed to your instigation, direct or indirect, as it is not
unknown that I have been on terms of intimacy with you.
Yet I own I should be sorry to have it lost, as I think it is
the most eloquent and manly composition I ever produced.
If you think it worth the postage, it shall be transcribed,
and I will send you the original. The passage in question
was the grossest and most disgusting <em>kick-up</em> of envy that
has deformed even the <cite>E. R.</cite> Had the author had the truth
before his eyes, and purposely written in diametrical opposition,
he could not have succeeded better. It is high time
that the spear of Ithuriel should touch the toad at the ear of
the public.</p>

<p>I would willingly inform you of my chance of success in
obtaining a sufficient number of subscribers, so as to justify
me prudentially in commencing the work (<cite>The Friend</cite>), but
I do not at present possess grounds even for a sane conjecture.
It will depend in a great measure on the zeal of my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_41" title="41"></a>
friends, on which I confess, not without remorse, I have more
often cast water than oil. Here a conceit about the Greek
fire might come in, but the simile is somewhat <em>tritical</em>.</p>

<p>Wordsworth has nearly finished a series of masterly essays
on our late and present relations to Portugal and Spain.
Southey is sending to the press his <cite>History of Brazil</cite>, and
at the same time (the indefatigable!) composing a defence
of religious missions to the East, etc. Excepting the introduction
(which, however, I have heard highly praised, but
myself think it shallow, flippant, and ipse dixitish), I have
read few books with such deep interest as the <cite>Chronicle of
the Cid</cite>. The whole scene in the Cortes is superior to any
equal part of any epic poem, save the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>&mdash;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">me
saltem judice</em>. The deep glowing, yet ever self-controlled
passion of the Cid&mdash;his austere dignity, so finely harmonizing
with his pride of loyal humility&mdash;the address to his swords,
and the burst of contemptuous rage in his final charge and
address to the Infantes of Carrion, and his immediate recall
of his mind&mdash;are beyond all ordinary praises. It delights
me to be able to speak thus of a work of Southey’s! I am
so often forced to quarrel with his want of judgment and his
unthinkingness&mdash;which, Heaven knows, I never do without
pain, and the vexation of a disappointed wish. But I am
encroaching on time more valuable than my own, and I,
too, have enough to do. May God grant you health and the
continuance of your intellectual vigour!</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_141"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 141. To Davy</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Grasmere, Kendal, December 14 (1808).</p>

<p>Dear Davy,</p>

<p>The above written copies<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> will explain this second
application to you. I understood from Mr. Bernard (after<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="42"></a>wards
Sir Thomas), as well as from yourself, that Mr.
Savage had agreed to print and publish the work on the sole
condition that he was to have five per cent. for the publisher,
and to charge the printing, etc., at the price charged to the
booksellers, or the <em>trade</em> (as they very ingenuously and truly
style their art and mystery). To spare me the necessity of
troubling Mr. Bernard with a fresh letter, I entreat you to
transmit this to him as soon as possible. There is but one
part of Mr. Savage’s letter that I can permit myself to comment
upon, that of the propriety of pricing the essay at
sixpence, and consequently of not having it stamped, nor
finely printed, nor on fine paper. For him, and for a work
conducted as he would have it conducted, <em>i.e.</em>, one, the
object of which is to attract as many purchasers as possible,
this might answer. My purposes are widely different. I do
not write in this work for the <em>multitude</em>, but for those who,
by rank or fortune, or official situation, or talents and habits
of reflection, are to <em>influence</em> the multitude. I write to found
true principles, to oppose false principles in criticism, legislation,
philosophy, morals, and international law. As giving
me an opportunity of explaining myself, I say Cobbett sells
his weekly sheet for tenpence. Now this differs from mine
in two points, mainly: First, he applies himself to the
passions that are gratified by curiosity, and sharp, often
calumnious, personality; by the events and political topics
of the day, and the names of notorious contemporaries.
Now, from all these I abstain altogether&mdash;nay, to strangle
this vicious temper of mind, by directing the interest to the
nobler germs in human nature, is my express and paramount
object. But of English readers three-fourths are led to
purchase periodical works in the expectation of gratifying
these passions&mdash;even periodical works professedly literary,
of which the keen interest excited by the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
and its wide circulation, yield a proof as striking as it is
dishonourable to the moral taste of the present public&mdash;all<a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" title="43"></a>
these readers I give up all claim to. Secondly, Cobbett
himself rarely writes more than a third of the weekly journal;
the remainder of the sheet is either mere reprinting or
stupid make-weights from correspondents (with few exceptions)
of the very lowest order. And what are his own
compositions? The undigested passionate monologues of a
man of robust natural understanding, but one unenriched by
various knowledge, undisciplined by a comprehensive philosophy;
under the warping influence of rooted habits of
opposing and attacking, and from this state of mind fruitful
in thoughts which a purer taste would have rejected so long,
that they would cease to occur, and promiscuous in the
adoption of whatever such a state of mind suggests to him
of these thoughts furnished by the occurrences of the day.
Indeed, more often than otherwise his letters, etc., are
mere comments on large <em>extracts</em> from the morning papers,
such as a passionate man would talk at breakfast over
a newspaper supporting the political party which he hated.
No <em>one</em> thesis is proposed&mdash;there is no orderly origination,
development, and conclusion; in short, none of those qualities
which constitute the <em>nicety</em> and <em>effort</em> of composition.
But <em>I</em> (and if I do not, my work will be dropped and
abandoned)&mdash;I bring the results of a life of intense study
and unremitted meditation, of toil and personal travels, and
great unrepaid expense. Those to whom these reasons
would not justify me in selling the work (stamped as Cobbett’s)
for that part of twopence more which remains when the
additional cost of finer paper and printing is deducted, I
neither expect nor wish to have among my subscribers. It
is scarcely necessary to remark, that in pointing out these
differences I had no intention of depreciating the political
journal (the style and contents of the work are perfectly well
suited to the purpose of the writer). The labourer’s pocket
knife was one excellently adapted to the cutting of bread
and cheese, but it would be unfair to demand that the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" title="44"></a>
medical cutler A. should sell his case of lancets at the same
price that the common cutler B. sells an equal weight of
the bread-and-cheese knives, supposing them both equally
good of their kind. This letter from Mr. Savage, added
to his long delay in answering me at all, has a good deal
perplexed my proceedings, but it shall not make me abandon
my intention.</p>

<p>If anything new have occurred in chemistry from your own
labours, or those of others, it would be deeply gratifying to
me to be informed of it by you; for hitherto I have not
been able to afford to take in any philosophical journal, or,
indeed, any other. I was told by a friend that William
Allen had proved that oxygen was absorbed in the lungs,
but that its action consisted in carrying off the carbon from
the blood&mdash;consequently that the old hypothesis of refrigeration
was not altogether false. But my communicant
was no chemist, and his account was so confused, that I am
not sure that I have given an accurate statement of it.</p>

<p>My health and spirits are far better than I had dared
hope, only from neglect of exercise I remain more corpulent
than I ought, though I drink nothing but table-beer, and
eat very moderately. When I was in London I was shocked
at the alteration in our friend Tobin’s looks and appearance.
Those who always interpret two coincidents into cause and
effect would surmise that marriage has been less conducive
to his health than to his moral comfort. It would give me
serious pleasure to have a more cheerful account of him.</p>

<p>As soon as I have a little leisure I shall send my Greek
accidence and vocabulary of terminations to the press with
my Greek-English Lexicon, which will be followed by a
Greek philosophical grammar. Heaven preserve and keep
you!</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_142"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 142. To Davy</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Grasmere, Kendal, Monday morning, January 30, 1809.</p>

<p>My dear Davy,</p>

<p>I was deeply affected by the passage in your letter
respecting Dr. Beddoes. It was indeed the echo of my own
experience. The intelligence of his departure from among
us, came upon me abruptly and unexpectedly. I was sitting
down to dinner, having quitted an unfinished sheet, which I
had been writing, in answer to a long and affectionate letter
from the Doctor. There was indeed a depth and flow of
feeling in it, which filled me with bodings, but I had no
thought that the event was so near at hand. The note,
therefore, sent from one of his patients, who had placed
himself at Clifton by mine and Wordsworth’s advice, (written)<a class="pagenum" id="Page_46" title="46"></a>
the day after his decease, struck me like a bodily blow, and
was followed by a long and convulsive weeping, with scarce
any inward suffering: but when some half hour after I
recovered myself, and my tears flowed slowly, and with
grief more worthy of the cause, I felt that more hope had
been taken out of my life by this than by any former event.
For Beddoes was good and beneficent to all men; but to
me he had always been kind and affectionate, and latterly I
had become attached to him by a personal tenderness. The
death of Mr. Thomas Wedgwood pulled hard at my heart;
I am sure no week of my life&mdash;almost I might have said
scarce a day, in which I have not been made either sad or
thoughtful by the recollection. But Dr. Beddoes’s death
has pulled yet harder, probably because it came second&mdash;likewise,
too, perhaps that I had been in the habit of connecting
such oppression of despondency with my love of
him. There are two things which I exceedingly wished,
and in both have been disappointed: to have written the
<cite>Life</cite> and prepared the <cite>Psychological Remains</cite> of my revered
friend and benefactor, T. W.: and to have been entrusted
with the <cite>Biography</cite>, etc., of Dr. B. This latter work
(Southey informs me) was first offered to you, and then to
Mr. Giddy, and is finally devolved on Dr. Stock. As my
heart bears me full witness with what unalloyed satisfaction
I should have seen this last duty in your hands or in
D. Giddy’s, so I feel myself permitted to avow the pain,
yea, the sense of shame, with which I contemplate Dr.
Stock as the performant. I could not help assenting to
Southey’s remark, that the proper vignette for the work
would be a funeral lamp beside an urn, and Dr. Stock in the
act of placing an extinguisher on it. * * *</p>

<p>I have just read a brief account of your first lecture of
this season, and, though I did not see as clearly as I could
wish, the pertinence of the religious declaration quoted from
you, and am not quite at ease (especially when I think of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" title="47"></a>
Darwin), when I find theosophy mingled with science, and
though I wished to have been with you to have expressed
my doubts concerning the accuracy of your comparison
between the great discoverers of science and the Miltons,
Spinozas, and Rafaels; yet the intervening history (it is
only that I am writing to you that I stopped and hesitate in
using the word) overwhelmed me, and I dare avow, furnished
to my understanding and conscience proofs more
convincing than the dim analogies of natural organization to
human mechanism, both of the Supreme Reason, as super-essential
to the world of the senses; of an analogous mind
in man not resulting from its perishable machine, nor even
from the general spirit of life, its inclosed steam or perfluent
water-force; and of the moral connection between the finite
and the infinite Reason, and the awful majesty of the
former, as both the revelation and the exponent voice of the
latter, immortal timepiece, an eternal sun. Shame be with
me in my death-hour if ever I withhold or fear to pay
my first debt of due honour to the truly great man, because
it has been my good lot to be his contemporary, or my
happiness to have known, esteemed, and loved, as well as
admired him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to pass otherwise than abruptly to my
own affairs. I had from the very first informed Mr. Savage<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
that I would not undertake the work at all, except I could
secure him from all possible risk. His proposals were such,
that had I acceded to them, after years of toil, I should
have been his debtor and slave, without having received a
farthing&mdash;or, to use the strong, coarse illustration of a friend,
a man of consummate good sense and knowledge of the
world, and of twenty years’ experience in periodical works&mdash;“Savage’s
proposals would have led you into a gulph of
debt or obligation: you would have been like a girl who<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"></a>
gets into a house of ill-fame, and whom the old bawd
always keeps in debt, stripping her of every shilling she gets
for prostitution.” What my error was, after my <em>first</em> conversation
with Mr. S. I know, but shall not say: but his
mistake has been in construing my indifference as to pecuniary
matters, and <em>apparent</em> ignorance of business, into
absolute silliness and passive idiocy. But this is passed.
As soon as I received his letter I made up my mind to
another mode of publication. <cite>The Friend</cite> will be printed as
a newspaper, <em>i.e.</em> not in form or matter, but under the act of
parliament, and with its privilege, printed at Kendal, and
sent to each subscriber by the post.</p>

<p>My health is more regular; yet, spite of severe attention
to my diet, etc., my sufferings are at times heavy. Please to
make my best respects to Mr. Bernard.</p>

<p>It is not unknown to you, that I have employed almost
the whole of my Life in acquiring, or endeavouring to
acquire, useful Knowledge by Study, Reflection, Observation,
and by cultivating the Society of my Superiors in
Intellect, both at Home and in foreign Countries. You
know too, that at different Periods of my Life I have not
only planned, but collected the materials for, many Works<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" title="49"></a>
on various and important Subjects: so many indeed, that
the Number of my unrealized Schemes, and the Mass of my
miscellaneous Fragments, have often furnished my Friends
with a Subject of Raillery, and sometimes of Regret and
Reproof. Waiving the Mention of all private and accidental
Hindrances, I am inclined to believe, that this Want of Perseverance
has been produced in the Main by an Over-activity
of Thought, modified by a constitutional Indolence,
which made it more pleasant to me to continue acquiring,
than to reduce what I had acquired to a regular Form.
Add too, that almost daily throwing off my Notices or
Reflections in desultory Fragments, I was still tempted
onward by an increasing Sense of the Imperfection of my
Knowledge, and by the Conviction, that, in Order fully to
comprehend and develope any one Subject, it was necessary
that I should make myself Master of some other, which
again as regularly involved a third, and so on, with an ever-widening
Horizon. Yet one Habit, formed during long
Absences from those with whom I could converse with full
Sympathy, has been of Advantage to me&mdash;that of daily
noting down, in my Memorandum or Common-place Books,
both Incidents and Observations; whatever had occurred to
me from without, and all the Flux and Reflux of my Mind
within itself. The Number of these Notices, and their
Tendency, miscellaneous as they were, to one common End
(“<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid sumus et quid futuri gignimur</em>,” <em>what we are and
what we are born to become; and thus from the End of our
Being to deduce its proper Objects</em>) first encouraged me to
undertake the Weekly Essay, of which you will consider
this Letter as the Prospectus.</p>

<p>Not only did the plan seem to accord better than any
other with the Nature of my own Mind, both in its Strength
and in its Weakness; but conscious that, in upholding
some Principles both of Taste and Philosophy, adopted by
the great Men of Europe from the Middle of the fifteenth<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="50"></a>
till toward the Close of the seventeenth Century, I must run
Counter to many Prejudices of many of my readers (<em>for old
Faith is often modern Heresy</em>) I perceived too in a periodical
Essay the most likely Means of winning, instead of forcing
my Way. Supposing Truth on my Side, the Shock of the
first Day might be so far lessened by Reflections of the
succeeding Days, so as to procure for my next Week’s Essay
a less hostile Reception, than it would have met with, had
it been only the next Chapter of a present Volume. I
hoped to disarm the Mind of those Feelings, which preclude
Conviction by Contempt, and, as it were, fling the Door in
the Face of Reasoning by a <em>Presumption</em> of its Absurdity.
A Motive too for honourable Ambition was supplied by the
Fact, that every periodical Paper of the Kind now attempted,
which had been conducted with Zeal and Ability, was not
only well received at the Time, but has become permanently,
and in the best Sense of the Word, popular. By honourable
Ambition I mean the strong Desire to be useful, aided by
the Wish to be generally acknowledged to have been so.
As I feel myself actuated in no ordinary Degree by this
Desire, so the Hope of realizing it appears less and less
presumptuous to me, since I have received from Men of
highest Rank and established Character in the Republic of
Letters, not only strong Encouragements as to my own
fitness for the Undertaking, but likewise Promises of
Support from their own Stores.</p>

<p>The <em>Object</em> of <cite>The Friend</cite>, briefly and generally expressed,
is&mdash;to uphold those Truths and those Merits, which are
founded in the nobler and permanent Parts of our Nature,
against the Caprices of Fashion, and such Pleasures, as
either depend on transitory and accidental Causes, or are
pursued from less worthy Impulses. The chief <em>Subjects</em> of
my own Essays will be:</p>

<div class="hang2">
<p>The true and sole Ground of Morality, or Virtue, as
distinguished from Prudence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" title="51"></a>The Origin and Growth of moral Impulses, as distinguished
from external and immediate Motives.</p>

<p>The necessary dependence of Taste on Moral Impulses
and Habits: and the Nature of Taste (relatively to
Judgment in general and to Genius) defined, illustrated,
and applied. Under this Head I comprize the
Substance of the Lectures given, and intended to have
been given, at the Royal Institution, on the distinguished
English Poets, in illustration of the general Principles
of Poetry; together with Suggestions concerning the
Affinity of the Fine Arts to each other, and the Principles
common to them all: Architecture; Gardening;
Dress; Music; Painting; Poetry.</p>

<p>The opening out of new Objects of just Admiration in
our own Language; and Information of the present
State and past History of Swedish, Danish, German,
and Italian Literature (to which, but as supplied by a
Friend, I may add the Spanish, Portuguese and
French) as far as the same has not been already given
to English Readers, or is not to be found in common
French Authors.</p>

<p>Characters met with in real Life:&mdash;Anecdotes and Results
of my own Life and Travels, etc. etc. as far as they are
illustrative of general moral Laws, and have no immediate
Bearing on personal or immediate Politics.</p>

<p>Education in its widest Sense, private and national.</p>

<p>Sources of Consolation to the afflicted in Misfortune, or
Disease, or Dejection of Mind, from the Exertion and
right Application of the Reason, the Imagination, and
the moral Sense; and new Sources of Enjoyment
opened out, or an Attempt (as an Illustrious Friend
once expressed the Thought to me) to add Sunshine to
Daylight, by making the Happy more happy. In the
words “Dejection of Mind” I refer particularly to
Doubt or Disbelief of the moral Government of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="52"></a>
World, and the grounds and arguments for the religious
Hopes of Human Nature.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>What really makes me despond is the daily confirmation
I receive of my original apprehension, that the plan and
execution of <cite>The Friend</cite> is so utterly unsuitable to the public
taste as to preclude all rational hopes of its success. Much,
certainly, might have been done to have made the former
numbers less so by the interposition of others written more
expressly for general interest; and, if I could attribute it
wholly to any removable error of my own, I should be less
dejected. I will do my best, will frequently interpose tales
and whole numbers of amusement, will make the periods
lighter and shorter; and the work itself, proceeding according
to its plan, will become more interesting when the
foundations have been laid. Massiveness is the merit of a
foundation; the gilding, ornaments, stucco-work, conveniences,
sunshine, and sunny prospects will come with the
superstructure. Yet still I feel the deepest conviction that
no efforts of mine, compatible with the hope of effecting any
good purpose, or with the duty I owe to my permanent reputation,
will remove the complaint. No real information
can be conveyed, no important errors radically extracted,
without demanding an effort of thought on the part of the
reader; but the obstinate, and now contemptuous, aversion
to all energy of thinking is the mother evil, the cause of all
the evils in politics, morals, and literature, which it is my
object to wage war against; so that I am like a physician who,
for a patient paralytic in both arms, prescribes, as the only<a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" title="53"></a>
possible cure, the use of the dumb-bells.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Whatever I publish,
and in whatever form, this obstacle will be felt. <cite>The
Rambler</cite>, which, altogether, has sold a hundred copies for
one of the <cite>Connoisseur</cite>, yet, during its periodical appearance,
did not sell one for fifty, and was dropped by reader
after reader for its dreary gravity and massiveness of manner.
Now what I wish you to do for me&mdash;if, amid your
many labours, you can find or make a leisure hour&mdash;is, to
look over the eight numbers, and to write a letter to <cite>The
Friend</cite> in a lively style, chiefly urging, in a humorous manner,
my Don Quixotism in expecting that the public will
ever pretend to understand my lucubrations, or feel any interest
in subjects of such sad and unkempt antiquity, and
contrasting my style with the cementless periods of the
modern Anglo-Gallican style, which not only are understood
<em>beforehand</em>, but, being free from all connections of logic, all
the hooks and eyes of intellectual memory, never oppress
the mind by any after recollections, but, like civil visitors,
stay a few moments, and leave the room quite free and open
for the next comers. Something of this kind, I mean, that
I may be able to answer it so as, in the answer, to state
my own convictions at full on the nature of obscurity,
etc. * * *</p>

<p class="dateline">[Without date.]</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I know not whether your subscribers have expected
too much from you, but it appears to me that you expect
too much from your subscribers; and that, however accur<a class="pagenum" id="Page_54" title="54"></a>ately
you may understand the diseases of the age, you have
certainly mistaken its temper. In the first place, Sir, your
essays are too long. “Brevity,” says a contemporary journalist,
“is the humour of the times; a tragedy must not exceed
fifteen hundred lines, a fashionable preacher must not trespass
above fifteen minutes upon his congregation. We have
short waistcoats and short campaigns; everything must be
short&mdash;except lawsuits, speeches in Parliament, and tax-tables.”
It is expressly stated, in the prospectus of a collection
of extracts, called the <cite>Beauties of Sentiment</cite>, that the
extracts shall always be complete sense, and <em>not very long</em>.
Secondly, Sir, though your essays appear in so tempting a
shape to a lounger, the very fiends themselves were not
more deceived by the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">lignum vitae</em> apples, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent4">They, fondly thinking to allay</div>
    <div class="line">Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit</div>
    <div class="line">Chew’d bitter ashes,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>than the reader is who takes up one of your papers from
breakfast table, parlour-window, sofa, or ottoman, thinking
to amuse himself with a few minutes’ light reading. We
are informed, upon the authority of no less a man than
Sir Richard Phillips, how “it has long been a subject of just
complaint among the lovers of English literature, that our
language has been deficient in lounging or parlour-window
books;” and to remove the opprobrium from the language,
Sir Richard advertises a list, mostly ending in <em>ana</em>, under
the general title of <cite>Lounging Books or Light Reading</cite>. I
am afraid, Mr. Friend, that your predecessors would never
have obtained their popularity unless their essays had been
of the description Ὅμοιον ὁμοίῳ φíλονi,&mdash;and this is a light
age.</p>

<p>You have yourself observed that few converts were made
by Burke; but the cause which you have assigned does not
sufficiently explain why a man of such powerful talents and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" title="55"></a>
so authoritative a reputation should have produced so little an
effect upon the minds of the people. Was it not because he
neither was nor could be generally understood? Because,
instead of endeavouring to make difficult things easy of
comprehension, he made things which were easy in themselves,
difficult to be comprehended by the manner in which
he presented them, evolving their causes and involving their
consequences, till the reader, whose mind was not habituated
to metaphysical discussions, neither knew in what his arguments
began nor in what they ended? You have told me
that the straightest line must be the shortest; but do not
you yourself sometimes nose out your way, hound-like, in
pursuit of truth, turning and winding, and doubling and
running when the same object might be reached in a tenth
part of the time by darting straightforward like a greyhound
to the mark? Burke failed of effect upon the people for this
reason,&mdash;there was the difficulty of mathematics without the
precision in his writings. You looked through the process
without arriving at the proof. It was the fashion to read
him because of his rank as a political partizan; otherwise he
would not have been read. Even in the House of Commons
he was admired more than he was listened to; not a sentence
came from him which was not pregnant with seeds of
thought, if it had fallen upon good ground; yet his speeches
convinced nobody, while the mellifluous orations of Mr. Pitt
persuaded his majorities of whatever he wished to persuade
them; because they were easily understood, what mattered
it to him that they were as easily forgotten?</p>

<p>The reader, Sir, must think before he can understand
you; is it not a little unreasonable to require from him an
effort which you have yourself described as so very painful
a one? and is not this effort not merely difficult but in many
cases impossible? All brains, Sir, were not made for thinking:
modern philosophy has taught us that they are galvanic
machines, and thinking is only an accident belonging to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_56" title="56"></a>
them. Intellect is not essential to the functions of life; in the
ordinary course of society it is very commonly dispensed
with; and we have lived, Mr. Friend, to witness experiments
for carrying on government without it. This is surely a
proof that it is a rare commodity; and yet you expect it in
all your subscribers!</p>

<p>Give us your moral medicines in a more “elegant preparation.”
The Reverend J. Gentle administers his physic in
the form of tea; Dr. Solomon prefers the medium of a
cordial; Mr. Ching exhibits his in gingerbread nuts; Dr.
Barton in wine; but you, Mr. Friend, come with a tonic
bolus, bitter in the mouth, difficult to swallow, and hard of
digestion.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p class="p2">My dear Coleridge,</p>

<p>All this, were it not for the Sir and the Mr. Friend,
is like a real letter from me to you: I fell into the strain
without intending it, and would not send it were it not to show
you that I have attempted to do something. From jest I got
into earnest, and, trying to pass from earnest to jest failed.
It was against the grain, and would not do. I had re-read
the eight last numbers, and the truth is, they left me no heart
for jesting or for irony. In time they will do their work; it
is the form of publication only that is unlucky, and that
cannot now be remedied. But this evil is merely temporary.
Give two or three amusing numbers, and you will hear of
admiration from every side. Insert a few more poems,&mdash;any
that you have, except <cite>Christabel</cite>, for that is of too much
value. There is scarcely anything you could do which would
excite so much notice as if you were <em>now</em> to write the character
of Bonaparte, announced in former times for “to-morrow.”
and to-morrow and to-morrow; and I think it
would do good by counteracting that base spirit of conde<a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" title="57"></a>scension
towards him, which I am afraid is gaining ground;
and by showing the people what grounds they have for
hope.</p>

<p>God bless you!</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_145"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 145. To R. L.</span><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></h3>

<p class="dateline">26 October, 1809.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>


<p>When I first undertook the present Publication for
the sake and with the <em>avowed</em> object of referring Men in all
things to <span class="smcap">Principles</span> or fundamental Truths, I was well
aware of the obstacles which the plan itself would oppose to
my success. For in order to the regular attainment of this
object, all the driest and least attractive Essays must appear
in the first fifteen or twenty Numbers, and thus subject me
to the necessity of demanding effort or soliciting patience in
that part of the Work, where it was most my interest to
secure the confidence of my Readers by winning their
favour. Though I dared warrant for the pleasantness of the
Journey on the whole; though I might promise that the
road would, for the far greater part of it, be found plain and
easy, that it would pass through countries of various prospect,
and that at every stage there would be a change of
company; it still remained a heavy disadvantage, that I had
to start at the foot of a high and steep hill: and I foresaw,
not without occasional feelings of despondency, that during
the slow and laborious ascent it would require no common
management to keep my Passengers in good humour with
the Vehicle and its Driver. As far as this inconvenience
could be palliated by sincerity and previous confession,
I have no reason to accuse myself of neglect. In the Prospectus
of <cite>The Friend</cite>, which for this cause I re-printed and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" title="58"></a>
annexed to the first Number, I felt it my duty to inform
such as might be inclined to patronize the Publication, that
I must submit to be esteemed dull by those who sought
chiefly for amusement: and this I hazarded as a <em>general</em>
confession, though in my own mind I felt a chearful confidence
that it would apply almost exclusively to the earlier
Numbers. I could not therefore be surprised, however much
I may have been depressed, by the frequency with which
you hear <cite>The Friend</cite> complained of for its abstruseness and
obscurity; nor did the highly flattering expressions, with
which you accompanied your communication, prevent me
from feeling its truth to the whole extent.</p>

<p>An Author’s pen like Children’s legs, improves by exercise.
That part of the blame which rests on myself, I am
exerting my best faculties to remove. A man long accustomed
to silent and solitary meditation, in proportion as he
encreases the power of thinking in long and connected trains,
is apt to lose or lessen the talent of communicating his
thoughts with grace and perspicuity. Doubtless too, I have
in some measure injured my style, in respect to its facility
and popularity, from having almost confined my reading, of
late years, to the Works of the Ancients and those of
the elder Writers in the modern languages. We insensibly
imitate what we habitually admire; and an aversion to the
epigrammatic unconnected periods of the fashionable <em>Anglo-gallican</em>
Taste has too often made me willing to forget, that
the stately march and difficult evolutions, which characterize
the eloquence of Hooker, Bacon, Milton, and Jeremy
Taylor, are, notwithstanding their intrinsic excellence, still
less suited to a periodical Essay. This fault I am now
endeavouring to correct; though I can never so far sacrifice
my judgment to the desire of being immediately popular,
as to cast my sentences in the French moulds, or affect a
style which an ancient critic would have deemed purposely
invented for persons troubled with the asthma to read, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" title="59"></a>
for those to comprehend who labour under the more pitiable
asthma of a short-witted intellect. It cannot but be injurious
to the human mind never to be called into effort:
the habit of receiving pleasure without any exertion of
thought, by the mere excitement of curiosity and sensibility,
may be justly ranked among the worst effects of habitual
novel reading. It is true that these short and unconnected
sentences are easily and instantly understood: but it is
equally true, that wanting all the cement of thought as well
as of style, all the connections, and (if you will forgive so
trivial a metaphor) all the <em>hooks-and-eyes</em> of the memory, they
are easily forgotten: or rather, it is scarcely possible that
they should be remembered.&mdash;Nor is it less true, that those
who confine their reading to such books dwarf their own
faculties, and finally reduce their Understandings to a deplorable
imbecility: the fact you mention, and which I shall
hereafter make use of, is a fair instance and a striking illustration.
Like idle morning Visitors, the brisk and breathless
Periods hurry in and hurry off in quick and profitless succession;
each indeed for the moments of its stay prevents the
pain of vacancy, while it indulges the love of sloth; but all
together they leave the Mistress of the house (the soul I
mean) flat and exhausted, incapable of attending to her own
concerns, and unfitted for the conversation of more rational
Guests.</p>

<p>I know you will not suspect me of fostering so idle a
hope, as that of obtaining acquittal by recrimination; or
think that I am attacking one fault, in order that its opposite
may escape notice in the noise and smoke of the
battery. On the contrary, I shall do my best, and even
make all allowable sacrifices, to render my manner more
attractive and my matter more generally interesting. All the
principles of my future Work, all the fundamental doctrines,
in the establishment of which I must of necessity require
the attention of my Reader to become my fellow-labourer;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" title="60"></a>
all the primary facts essential to the intelligibility of my
principles, the existence of which facts I can prove to others
only as far as I can prevail on them to retire <em>into themselves</em>
and make their own minds the objects of their stedfast
attention; these will, all together, not occupy more than six
or seven of my future Essays, and between each of these I
shall interpose one or more Numbers devoted to the
rational <em>entertainment</em> of my various Readers; and, partly
from the desire of gratifying particular requests, and partly
as a specimen of the subjects which will henceforward have
a due proportion of <cite>The Friend</cite> allotted to them, I shall fill
up the present Paper with a miscellany. I feel too deeply
the importance of the convictions which first impelled me
to the present undertaking, to leave unattempted any
honourable means of recommending them to as wide a circle
as possible; and though all the opinions which I shall bring
forward in the course of the Work, on politics, morals, religion,
literature, and the fine arts, will with all their applications,
be strictly deducible from the principles established
in these earlier Numbers; yet I doubt not, that being Truths
and interesting Truths (and such, of course, I must be supposed
to deem them) their intrinsic beauty will procure them
introduction to the feelings of my Readers, even of those
whose habits or avocations preclude the fatigue of close
reasoning, and that each Essay of itself, by the illustrations
and the auxiliary and independent arguments appropriate to
it, will become sufficiently intelligible and evident.</p>

<p>Hitherto, my dear Sir, I have been employed in laying
the Foundation of my Work. But the proper merit of a
foundation is its massiveness and solidity. The conveniences
and ornaments, the gilding and stucco work, the sunshine
and sunny prospects, will come with the Superstructure.
Yet I dare not flatter myself, that any endeavours of
mine, compatible with the duty I owe to Truth and the
hope of permanent utility, will render <cite>The Friend</cite> agreeable<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" title="61"></a>
to the majority of what is called the reading Public. I never
expected it. How indeed could I, when I was to borrow so
little from the influence of passing Events, and absolutely
excluded from my plan all appeals to personal curiosity and
personal interests? Yet even this is not my greatest impediment.
No real information can be conveyed, no important
errors rectified, no widely injurious prejudices rooted up,
without requiring some effort of thought on the part of the
Reader. But the obstinate (and toward a contemporary
Writer, the contemptuous) aversion to all intellectual effort
is the mother evil of all which I had proposed to war against,
the Queen Bee in the Hive of our errors and misfortunes,
both private and national. The proof of the Fact, positively
and comparatively, and the enumeration of its various causes,
will, as I have already hinted form the preliminary Essay of
the disquisition on the elements of our moral and intellectual
faculties. To solicit the attention of those on whom these
debilitating causes have acted to their full extent, would be
no less absurd than to recommend exercise with the dumb
bells, as the only mode of cure, to a patient paralytic in
both arms. You, my dear Sir, well know, that my expectations
were more modest as well as more rational. I hoped,
that my Readers in general would be aware of the impracticability
of suiting every Essay to every Taste in <em>any</em> period of
the work; and that they would not attribute wholly to the
Author, but in part to the necessity of his plan, the austerity
and absence of the lighter graces in the first fifteen or
twenty Numbers. In my cheerful moods I sometimes flattered
myself, that a few even among those, who foresaw that
my lucubrations would at all times require more attention
than from the nature of their own employments they could
afford them, might yet find a pleasure in supporting <cite>The
Friend</cite> during its infancy, so as to give it a chance of
attracting the notice of others, to whom its style and subjects
might be better adapted. But my main anchor was the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" title="62"></a>
Hope, that when circumstances gradually enabled me to
adopt the ordinary means of making the Publication generally
known, there might be found throughout the Kingdom
a sufficient number of meditative minds, who, entertaining
similar convictions with myself, and gratified by the prospect
of seeing them reduced to form and system, would take a
warm interest in the work from the very circumstance, that
it wanted those allurements of transitory interest, which
render particular patronage superfluous, and for the brief
season of their Blow and Fragrance attract the eye of thousands,
who would pass unregarded</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent30">Flowers</div>
    <div class="line">Of sober tint, and Herbs of med’cinable powers.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I hoped that a sufficient number of such Readers would
gradually be obtained, as to secure for the Paper that small
extent of circulation and immediate Sale, which would permit
the Editor to carry it on to its conclusion, and that they
might so far interest themselves in recommending it to men
of kindred judgments among their acquaintances, that the
alterations in my list of Subscribers should not be exclusively
of a discouraging nature. Hitherto, indeed, I have
only to express gratitude, and acknowledge constancy; but
I do not attempt to disguise from myself that I owe this, in
many instances, to a generous reluctance hastily to withdraw
from an Undertaking in its first struggles, and before
the Adventurer had had a fair opportunity of displaying the
quality of his goods, or the foundations of his credit.</p>

<p>* * *&mdash;the one tantum vidi: the other I know by his
works only and his public character. To profess indifference
to their praises would convict me either of insensibility
or insincerity. Yet (and I am sure, that you will both understand,
and sympathize with, the feeling) my delight was not
unalloyed by a something like pain, as if I were henceforward
less free to express my admiration of them with the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="63"></a>
same warmth and affection, which I have been accustomed
to do, before I had even anticipated the honour of such a
communication. You will therefore not judge me too
harshly, if so confirmed and cheered, I have sometimes in
the warmth of composition, and while I was reviewing the
materials of the more important part of my intended Essays,
if I had sometimes permitted my Hopes a bolder flight; and
counted on a share of favour and protection from the
soberly zealous among the professionally Learned, when the
Principles of <cite>The Friend</cite> shall have been brought into clear
view, and Specimens have been given of the mode and the
direction in which I purpose to apply and enforce them.</p>

<p>There are charges, the very suspicion of which is painful
to an ingenuous mind in exact proportion as they are unfounded
and inapplicable. I can bear with resignation a
charge of enthusiasm. Even if accused of presumption, I
will repay myself by deriving from the accusation an additional
motive to increased watchfulness over myself, that I
may remain entitled to plead, Not guilty! to it in the Court
of my own conscience. But if my anxiety to obviate hasty
judgments and misapprehensions is imputed to a less
honourable motive than the earnest wish to exert my best
faculties, as to the most beneficial purposes, so in the way
most likely to effectuate them, I can give but one answer:
that however great my desires of <em>profit</em> may be, they cannot
be greater than my ignorance of the world, if I have chosen
a weekly paper planned, as <cite>The Friend</cite> is, written on such
subjects, and composed in such a style, as the most promising
method of gratifying them.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_146"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 146. To Cantab</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">21 Dec. 1809.</p>

<p>I thank the “<em>Friend’s friend and a Cantab</em>” for his inspiriting
Letter, and assure him, that it was not without its<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" title="64"></a>
intended effect, of giving me encouragement. That this was
not needless, he would feel as well as know, if I could convey
to him the anxious thoughts and gloomy anticipations,
with which I write any single paragraph, that demands the
least effort of attention, or requires the Reader to enter into
himself and question his own mind as to the truth of that
which I am pressing on his notice. But both He and my
very kind Malton Correspondent, and all of similar dispositions,
may rest assured, that with every imaginable endeavour
to make <cite>The Friend</cite>, <em>collectively,</em> as <em>entertaining</em> as is compatible
with the main Object of the Work, I shall never so
far forget the duty, I owe to them and to my own heart, as not
to remember that <em>mere</em> amusement is <em>not</em> that main Object.
I have taken upon myself (see Letter 145) all the blame
that I could acknowledge without adulation to my readers and
hypocritical mock-humility. But the principal source of the
obscurity imputed must be sought for in the want of <em>interest</em>
concerning the truths themselves. (<cite>Revel.</cite> iii, 17.) My sole
Hope (I dare not say expectation) is, that if I am enabled to
proceed with the work through an equal number of Essays
with those already published, it will gradually find for itself
its appropriate Public.</p>

<span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
</div>

<p>Coleridge worked pretty hard at <cite>The Friend</cite>. He was ably
assisted by Miss Sarah Hutchinson, who acted as amanuensis.
<cite>The Friend</cite> was first issued on 1st June 1809, and
ceased with the twenty-seventh number on 10th March
1810. Like <cite>The Watchman</cite>, <cite>The Friend</cite> was published
by subscription and was not a financial success. In <cite>The
Friend</cite> Coleridge wrote in his most diffuse style. The long
intricate sentence, imitative of that of the seventeenth century
divines and political writers, was his favourite medium
when writing on the Permanent Principles of things, and in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" title="65"></a>
it he often ran into prolixity. In a letter to Poole, of 28th
January 1810 (<cite>Letters</cite>, 556), Coleridge defends himself for
abandoning the Frenchified style of the <cite>Spectator</cite>, and the
eighteenth-century Belles-Lettrists, who, in his estimation,
had contributed to the taste for “unconnected writing” and
“Reading made easy.” Coleridge tried to awaken a deeper
note in the English magazine, and make the periodical
a vehicle for profound reflection and logically connected
thought; and although Coleridge’s own age was against him in
this, the latter half of the nineteenth century has reversed
the verdict in his favour.</p>

<p>While busy with <cite>The Friend</cite>, Coleridge was again contributing
to <cite>The Courier</cite> a series of letters supporting the
Spaniards in their struggle against Napoleon, and endeavouring
to maintain British sympathy for the inhabitants of the
Peninsula. These letters are written with Coleridge’s accustomed
virility when writing for <cite>The Courier</cite>, and are almost
as good as his Letters to Fox of 1802. It is a curious fact
that when Coleridge stepped into <cite>The Courier</cite> office, he
abandoned for the time being his over-refinement of ideas
and subtle disquisitive method of writing for a more popular
style, as good as any leader-writer of the day. He had great
versatility of talent in prose; in fact he had three styles of
writing&mdash;his Philosophic style, his Journalist style, and his
Letter-Writer’s style, in the last of which he abandoned himself
to the most curious and humorous freaks of construction
and imagery, as when he apologizes for some warmth of expression,
calling it “the dexterous <em>toss</em>, necessary to turn an
idea out of its pudding-bag, round and <em>unbroken</em>.”&mdash;<cite>Letters</cite>,
410.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">QUARREL WITH WORDSWORTH, SECOND
COURSE OF LECTURES ON
SHAKESPEARE</span></h2>

<p>[During the remainder of 1810, after the cessation of
<cite>The Friend</cite>, Coleridge did nothing of importance
except write letters to his acquaintances about new projects
which grew up in the impetuosity of his conversation or in
answering some enquiry to a correspondent. At the close of
the year Coleridge had determined to go to London once
more; and an unfortunate occurrence took place on his
arrival in London. Basil Montagu with his wife and child
were travelling from Scotland to London, and called upon
the Wordsworths at Allan Bank, where Coleridge resided
with brief intervals of absence from September 1808 to
April 1810. Montagu invited Coleridge to travel to the
metropolis with him in his chaise and stay some time at his
residence. Wordsworth warned Montagu of Coleridge’s
opium habit, and said something to the effect that “he had
no hope” of Coleridge, and perhaps that he had been a
“nuisance” in the Wordsworth family. On his arrival in
London, Montagu informed Coleridge that Wordsworth had
commissioned him to say that Wordsworth had no hope of
him, and that certain habits of his had made him a nuisance
in the Allan Bank household (Dykes Campbell’s <cite>Life</cite>, 179).
Coleridge, of course, left the Montagus on hearing this communication,
and repaired to 7, Portland Place, Hammersmith,
then the abode of his old friend John Morgan, and his wife<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="67"></a>
Mary Brent, and her sister Charlotte Brent, with whom the
father of the ladies also lived (<cite>Letters</cite>, 598).</p>

<p>Coleridge was deeply stung that Wordsworth should have
said such a thing to Montagu. Professor Knight in his
<cite>Life of Wordsworth</cite> gives a pretty full narrative of the
event, and believes that Wordsworth, though he said he had
no hope of Coleridge, did not utter the more offensive
assertion about Coleridge being a nuisance in his family.
Henry Crabb Robinson effected a formal reconciliation
between the two poets, in which both figure to some disadvantage.
Wordsworth’s proposal to confront Coleridge, his
best and closest friend, with Montagu, a comparative stranger
to both of them, for cross-examination, and thus sift out the
actual expression used by the latter to the former, seems like
very hard dealing; and Coleridge’s vehemence of protestation
to believe whatever Wordsworth asserted to be the true
version, in contradistinction to anything that Montagu might
say, savours of unreality. Wordsworth’s taking offence at
Coleridge not going to Grasmere on the death of his child at a
juncture when it was impossible for him to leave London while
<cite>Remorse</cite> was being put on the stage, does not redound to the
credit of the Bard of Rydal; and Coleridge’s failure to call
on his old friend while in the Lake District for the last time
is equally against the poet of Stowey. The estrangement died
down rather than was reconciled; but the irritation against
Wordsworth remained long in Coleridge’s heart, and it is more
than probable that after the excitement of the reconciliation
made by Crabb Robinson was over, Coleridge believed
Montagu’s rather than Wordsworth’s version of what had
occurred. This is endorsed by the fact that Montagu was
again taken into favour, and he and his wife were regular
guests at the Highgate Thursdays in after times.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>During 1811, while in London, Coleridge again met<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="68"></a>
Godwin, to whom he softened in his opinion. The following
two letters indicate that he did not occupy the same attitude
to the author of <cite>Political Justice</cite> as he did when he wrote
<cite>The Watchman</cite>.</p>

<p>I half caught from Lamb that you had written to Wordsworth,
with a wish that he should versify some tale or other,
and that Wordsworth had declined it. I told dear Miss
Lamb that I had formed a complete plan of a poem, with
little plates for children, the <em>first</em> thought, but that alone,
taken from Gessner’s <cite>First Mariner</cite>; and this thought, I
have reason to believe, was not an invention of Gessner’s.
It is this&mdash;that in early times, in some island or part of the
Continent, the ocean had rushed in, overflowing a vast plain
of twenty or thirty miles, and thereby <em>insulating</em> one small
promontory or cape of high land, on which was a cottage,
containing a man and his wife, and an infant daughter.
This is the <em>one</em> thought; all that Gessner has made out of it&mdash;(and
I once translated into blank verse about half of the
poem, but gave it up under the influence of a double dis<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" title="69"></a>gust,
moral and poetical)&mdash;I have rejected; and, strictly
speaking, the tale in all its parts, that one idea excepted,
would be original. The tale will contain the cause, the occasions,
the process, with all its failures and ultimate success,
of the construction of the first boat, and of the undertaking
of the first naval expedition. Now, supposing you liked the
idea (I address you and Mrs. G., and as <em>commerciants</em>, not
you as the philosopher who gave us the first system in England
that ever dared reveal at full that most important of
all important truths, that morality might be built on its own
foundation, like a castle built <em>from</em> the rock and <em>on</em> the
rock, with religion for the ornaments and completion of its
roof and upper stories&mdash;nor as the critic who, in the life of
Chaucer, has given us, if not principles of <em>æsthetic</em> or taste,
yet more and better data for principles than had hitherto
existed in our language)if we pulling like two friendly
tradesmen together, (for you and your wife <em>must</em> be one
flesh, and I trust <em>are</em> one heart) you approve of the plan,
the next question is, Whether it should be written in prose
or in verse, and if the latter, in what metre&mdash;stanzas, or
eight-syllable iambics with rhymes (for in rhyme it must be),
now in couplets and now in quatrains, in the manner of
Cooper’s admirable translation of the <cite>Vert-Vert</cite> of Gresset.
(N.B. not <em>the</em> Cowper).</p>

<p>Another thought has struck me within the last month, of
a school-book in two octavo volumes, of Lives in the
manner of Plutarch&mdash;not, indeed, of comparing and coupling
Greek with Roman, Dion with Brutus, and Cato with
Aristides, of placing ancient and modern together: Numa
with Alfred, Cicero with Bacon, Hannibal with Gustavus
Adolphus, and Julius Cæsar with Buonaparte&mdash;or what
perhaps might be at once more interesting and more instructive,
a series of lives, from Moses to Buonaparte, of all
those great men, who in states or in the mind of man had
produced great revolutions, the effects of which still remain,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" title="70"></a>
and are more or less distant causes of the present state of
the world.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_148"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 148. To Godwin</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Friday morning, March 29, 1811.</p>

<p>Dear Godwin,</p>

<p>My chief motive in undertaking <cite>The First Mariner</cite>
is merely to weave a few tendrils around your destined
walking-stick, which, like those of the woodbine (that,
serpent-like climbing up, and with tight spires embossing
the straight hazel, rewards the lucky schoolboy’s search in
the winter copse) may remain on it, when the woodbine,
root and branch, lies trampled in the earth. I shall consider
the work as a small plot of ground given up to you, to
be sown at your own hazard with your own seed (gold-grains
would have been but a bad saw, and besides have
spoilt the metaphor). If the increase should more than
repay your risk and labour, why then let me be one of
your guests at Hendcot House. Your last letter impressed
and affected me strongly. Ere I had yet read or seen your
works, I, at Southey’s recommendation, wrote a sonnet in
praise of the author. When I had read them, religious
bigotry, the but half-understanding your principles, and the
<em>not</em> half-understanding my own, combined to render me a
warm and boisterous anti-Godwinist. But my warfare was
open; my unfelt and harmless blows aimed at an abstraction
I had christened with your name; and at that time, if not
in the world’s <em>favor</em>, you were among the captains and chief
men in its admiration. I became your acquaintance, when<a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" title="71"></a>
more years had brought somewhat more temper and tolerance;
but I distinctly remember that the first turn in my
mind towards you, the first movements of a juster appreciation
of your merits, was occasioned by my disgust at the
altered tone of language of many whom I had long known
as your admirers and disciples&mdash;some of them, too, men
who had made themselves a sort of reputation in minor
circles as your acquaintances, and therefore your echoes by
authority, who had themselves aided in attaching an unmerited
ridicule to you and your opinions by their own
ignorance, which led them to think the best settled truths,
and indeed <em>every</em> thing in your <cite>Political Justice</cite>, whether
assertion, or deduction, or conjecture, to have been new
thoughts&mdash;downright creations! and by their own vanity,
which enabled them to forget that everything must be new
to him who knows <em>nothing</em>; others again, who though gifted
with high talents, had yet been indebted to you and the discussions
occasioned by your work, for much of their development,
who had often and often styled you the Great Master,
written verses in your honour, and, worse than all, had now
brought your opinions&mdash;with many good and worthy men&mdash;into
as unmerited an odium, as the former class had into
contempt, by attempts equally unfeeling and unwise, to
realize them in private life, to the disturbance of domestic
peace. And lastly, a third class; but the name of &mdash;&mdash; spares
me the necessity of describing it. In all these there was such a
want of common sensibility, such a want of that gratitude to
an intellectual benefactor, which even an honest reverence for
their past selves should have secured, as did then, still does,
and ever will, disgust me. As for &mdash;&mdash;, I cannot justify him;
but he stands in no one of the former classes. When he was
young he just looked enough into your books to believe you
taught republicanism and stoicism; ergo, that he was of
your opinion and you of his, and that was all. Systems of
philosophy were never his taste or forte. And I verily<a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" title="72"></a>
believe that his conduct originated wholly and solely in the
effects which the trade of reviewing never fails to produce at
certain times on the best minds,&mdash;presumption, petulance,
callousness to personal feelings, and a disposition to
treat the reputations of their contemporaries as playthings
placed at their own disposal. Most certainly I cannot
approve of such things; but yet I have learned how difficult
it is for a man who has from earliest childhood preserved
himself immaculate from all the common faults and weaknesses
of human nature, and who, never creating any small
disquietudes, has lived in general esteem and honour, to
feel remorse, or to admit that he has done wrong. Believe
me, there is a bluntness of conscience superinduced by a
very unusual infrequency, as well as by a habit of frequency
of wrong actions. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sunt quibus cecidisse prodesset,</span>” says
Augustine. To this add that business of review-writing,
carried on for fifteen years together, and which I have
never hesitated to pronounce an immoral employment,
unjust to the author of the books reviewed, injurious in
its influences on the public taste and morality, and still more
injurious on its influences on the head and heart of the
reviewer himself. The <em>prægustatores</em> among the luxurious
Romans soon lost their taste; and the verdicts of an old
prægustator were sure to mislead, unless when, like dreams,
they were interpreted into contraries. Our reviewers are
the genuine descendants of these palate-seared taste dictators.
I am still confined by indisposition, but mean to
step out to Hazlitt’s&mdash;almost my next door neighbour&mdash;at
his particular request. It is possible that I may find you
there.</p>

<p>With kind remembrances to Mrs. Godwin,</p>

<span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge</span>.
</div>

<p>From 19th April to 27th September 1811 Coleridge<a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" title="73"></a>
(<cite>Essays on his Own Times</cite>, 733&ndash;938) was busy contributing
articles again to <cite>The Courier</cite> on all subjects of the day, their
irony as bright, their imagery as fresh, their philosophy as
sound as anything he had formerly written. But Coleridge
ceased to write for <cite>The Courier</cite> when he discovered that it
was not an independent paper. An article on the Duke of
York written by Coleridge, after having been set up in type, was
suppressed, at the instigation of the Government. He wrote
to Beaumont on 7th December 1811: “I have not been at
<cite>The Courier</cite> office for some months past. I detest writing
politics even on the right side; and when I discovered that
<cite>The Courier</cite> was not the independent paper I had been led
to believe, and had myself over and over again asserted, I
wrote no more for it.... I will write for the <cite>Permanent</cite>, or
not at all.” (Coleorton <cite>Memorials</cite> ii, 162, 7th December
1811.)</p>

<p>During the winter of 1811&ndash;12 Coleridge did something
for the <cite>Permanent</cite> in the shape of a new course of Lectures
on Shakespeare. The course lasted from the beginning of
November 1811 to 28th January 1812. The Lectures are
published in T. Ashe’s edition (Bohn Library, pp. 33&ndash;165).
The finest of the Lectures is No. IX, given on 16th December
1811. The Lectures were delivered at the London
Philosophical Society’s Rooms, Fetter Lane, and were attended,
according to Henry Crabb Robinson, by enthusiastic
audiences; and the course closed with <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</em>. On one
occasion Rogers and Byron were present. The following
letter to Dr. Andrew Bell, whom, it will be remembered, he
corresponded with while he was giving his first course, is a
characteristic bit of Coleridge’s application of the Law of
Association.</p>

<div class="dateline">
  <div class="pad10">Mr. Pople’s, 67 Chancery Lane</div>
  <div>Holborn, 30 November 1811.</div>
</div>

<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The room I lecture in is very comfortable, and of a
grave academic appearance; the company highly respectable,
though (unluckily) rather scanty; but the entrance,
which is under a short passage from Fetter Lane, some
thirty doors or more from Fleet Street, is disagreeable even
to foot-comers, and far more so to carriages, from the narrowness
and bendings of the lane. This, and in truth, the
very name of <em>Fetter</em> Lane, renowned exclusively for pork
and sausages, have told against me; and I pay an exorbitant
price in proportion to the receipts. I should doubtless feel
myself honoured by your attendance on some one night;
but such is your distance, and such is the weather, that I
scarce dare <em>wish</em> it, much less ask or expect it.</p>

<p>I wrote a long letter to you concerning the sophistications
of your system at present in vogue, the inevitable consequences
on the whole mass of moral feelings, even of the
dissenters themselves, and the courage as well as fortitude,
required for the effort to do one’s duty. But I asked myself
why I should give you pain, and destroyed it. Yet come
what will, the subject shall be treated fully, intrepidly, and
by close deduction from settled first principles, in the first
volume of the recommencing <cite>Friend</cite>, which I hope to bring
out early in the spring, on a quarterly or four-monthly plan,
in partnership with a publisher who is personally my friend,
and who will take on himself all the <em>business</em>, and leave me
exclusively occupied in the composition. Even to this day I
have not received nearly one-half of the subscriptions for
the former numbers, and am expiating the error by all sorts
of perplexities and embarrassments. A man who has nothing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" title="75"></a>
better than prudence is fit for no world to come; and he
who does not possess it in full activity, is as unfit for the
present world. What then shall we say? Have both prudence
and the moral sense, but subordinate the former to
the latter; and so possess the flexibility and address of the
serpent to glide through the brakes and jungles of this life,
with the wings of the dove to carry us upward to a better!</p>

<p>May the Almighty bless and preserve you, my dear Sir!
With most unfeigned love and honour, I remain&mdash;and till I
lose all sense of my better being, of the veiled immortal
within me, ever must remain, your obliged and grateful
friend,</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_76" title="76"></a><a id="CHAP_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="subtitle">DANIEL STUART AND THE COURIER</span></h2>

<p class="p2">Here<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I may best introduce the remarks which have
been made, and details which have been given, respecting
Mr. Coleridge’s services to <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and
<cite>The Courier</cite>, spoken of by him in Chapter X of the <cite>Biographia
Literaria</cite>. That representation has been excepted against by
Mr. Stuart, who was Editor of the former Paper when my
Father wrote for it, and half proprietor of the other. The
view which he takes of the case he has already made
public;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he seems to be of opinion, that the language used
by Mr. Coleridge in this work is calculated to give an impression
of the amount of his actual performances on behalf
of those papers beyond what the facts warrant; I have not
thought it necessary or proper to withdraw that portion of
Chapter X of which he complains, nor do I see that it must
necessarily bear a construction at variance with his own
statements: but neither would I republish it, without giving
Mr. Stuart’s account of matters to which it refers, extracted
from letters written by him to Mr. Coleridge’s late Editor.
He writes as follows from Wykham Park, on the 7th of
October, 1835.</p>

<p>“In August, 1795, I began to conduct <cite>The Morning<a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" title="77"></a>
Post</cite>, the sale of which was so low, only 350 per day, that a
gentleman at that time made a bet with me that the Paper
was actually extinct.</p>

<p>“At Christmas, 1797, on the recommendation of Mr.
Mackintosh, Coleridge sent me several pieces of poetry; up
to the time of his going to Germany, about 12 pieces.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Prose writing I never expected from him at that time. He
went to Germany in the summer of 1798.</p>

<p>“He returned, I believe, about the end of 1799,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and
proposed to me to come to London to reside near me, and
write daily for the paper. I took lodgings for him in King
Street, Covent Garden. <cite>The Morning Post</cite> then selling
2,000 daily. Coleridge wrote some things, particularly, I
remember, Comments on Lord Grenville’s reply to Buonaparte’s
Overtures of Peace, in January, 1800. But he totally
failed in the plan he proposed of writing daily on the daily
occurrences.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stuart then gives three short letters of Mr. C.’s, showing
how often he was ill and incapable of writing for the
paper, and the beginning of a long one dated Greta Hall,
Keswick, 19th July, 1800,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in which he promises a second
part of Pitt and Buonaparte, but speaks of it as uncertain
whether or no he should be able to continue any regular
species of employment for Mr. S.’s paper.</p>

<p>After noting that Mr. C. left London at the end of his
first half year’s engagement, Mr. S. brings forward more
letters, containing excuses on account of illness, but promising
a number of essays: two on the war, as respecting
agriculture; one on the raising of rents; one on the riots<a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>
(corn riots in 1800); and one on the countenance by Government
of calumnies on the King;&mdash;promising also a second
part of Pitt and Buonaparte, which Mr. S. supposes he was
constantly dunning for, the Character of Pitt, published in
<cite>The M. P.</cite> early in 1800, having made a great sensation;
proposing a letter to Sir F. Burdett on solitary imprisonment,
and that all these should be published in pamphlets,
after they had been divided into pieces, and published in
<cite>The M. P.</cite>, he doubting whether they were of value for a
newspaper. Some of these essays appear to have been sent;
it is not specified which or how many.</p>

<p>“Early in 1807,” Mr. S. says, “I was confined by a violent
fever. Several weeks I was delirious, and to my astonishment,
when I recovered, Pitt was out of place, and Horne
Tooke in Parliament. I did not resume the conduct of the
Paper till the spring. The Paper suffered loss.”</p>

<p>The next letter, dated May, 1801, Keswick, speaks of ill
health, and “the habits of irresolution which are its worst
consequences,” forbidding him to rely on himself. Mr. S.
had solicited him to write, and offered terms, and it appears
that he did form a new engagement for the Paper about that
time. In a letter of Sept. 1801, he says, “I am not so
blinded by authorship as to believe that what I have done
is at all adequate to the money I have received.” Mr. Stuart
then produces a letter with the postmark Bridgewater, of
Jan. 19, 1802.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> These letters show, he says, that in July and
October 1800, in May 1801, on the 30th of September 1801,
Coleridge was at Keswick, that in January 1802, he was at
Stowey, that he could not therefore have materially contributed
to the success of <cite>The Morning Post</cite>. “In this last
year,” says Mr. Stuart, “his Letters to Judge Fletcher, and
on Mr. Fox, at Paris, were published.” The former were not
published till 1814. The six letters appeared in <cite>The Courier</cite><a class="pagenum" id="Page_79" title="79"></a>
on Sept. 20th, 29th, Oct. 21st, Nov. 2nd, Dec. 3rd, 6th, 9th
and 10th. The latter appeared on the 4th and 9th of Nov.
1802. Mr. Stuart speaks of it as a mistake in those who
have supposed that the coolness of Fox to Sir James Mackintosh
was occasioned by his ascribing this “violent philippic,”
as Lamb called it, to him (Sir James). “On those to
Judge Fletcher,” he says, “and many other such essays, as
being rather fit for pamphlets than newspapers, I did not set
much value.” On this subject hear Coleridge himself in a
letter<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> dated June 4th, 1811, when he was engaged with
Mr. Street.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_150"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 150. To Daniel Stuart</span></h3>

<p>“Freshness of effect belongs to a newspaper and distinguishes
it from a literary book: the former being the Zenith
and the latter the Nadir, with a number of intermediate
degrees, occupied by pamphlets, magazines, reviews, etc.
Besides, in a daily paper, with advertisements proportioned
to its large sale, what is deferred must four times in five be
extinguished. A newspaper is a market for flowers and vegetables,
rather than a granary or conservatory; and the drawer
of its Editor a common burial ground, not a catacomb for
embalmed mummies, in which the defunct are preserved to
serve in after times as medicines for the living.”</p>

<p>This freshness of effect Coleridge scarcely ever gave to
either <cite>The Morning Post</cite> or <cite>The Courier</cite>. He was occasionally
in London during my time, in <cite>The Morning Post</cite> it is
true, but he never gave the daily bread. He was mostly at
Keswick. * * * A few months in 1800, and a few weeks
in 1802, that was all the time he ever wasted on <cite>The Morning
Post</cite>, and as for <cite>The Courier</cite>, it accepted his proffered services
as a favour done to him,” etc.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_80" title="80"></a>After speaking again of the former paper, he says, “I
could give many more reasons for its rise than those I gave
in my former letter, and among others I would include
Coleridge’s occasional writings, though to them I would not
set down more than one hundredth part of the cause of success,
much as I esteemed his writings and much as I would
have given for a regular daily assistance by him. But he
never wrote a thing I requested, and, I think I may add, he
never wrote a thing I expected. In proof of this he promised
me at my earnest and endless request, the character of
Buonaparte, which he himself, at first of his own mere motion,
had promised; he promised it letter after letter, year after
year, for ten years (last for <cite>The Courier</cite>), yet never wrote it.
Could Coleridge and I place ourselves thirty-eight years
back, and he be so far a man of business as to write three
or four hours a day, there is nothing I would not pay for his
assistance. I would take him into partnership,” (which, I
think, my Father would have declined,) “and I would enable
him to make a large fortune. To write the leading paragraph
of a newspaper I would prefer him to Mackintosh,
Burke, or any man I ever heard of. His observations not
only were confirmed by good sense, but displayed extensive
knowledge, deep thought and well-grounded foresight; they
were so brilliantly ornamented, so classically delightful.
They were the writings of a Scholar, a Gentleman and a
Statesman, without personal sarcasm or illiberality of any
kind. But when Coleridge wrote in his study without being
pressed, he wandered and lost himself. He should always
have had the printer’s devil at his elbow with ‘Sir, the
printers want copy.’</p>

<p>“So far then with regard to <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, which I
finally left in August, 1803. Throughout the last year, during
my most rapid success, Coleridge did not, I believe, write a
line for me. Seven months afterwards I find Coleridge at
Portsmouth, on his way to Malta.” Mr. Stuart proceeds to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_81" title="81"></a>
state that Mr. C. returned to England in the summer of
1806, that in 1807 he was engaged with his Play at Drury
Lane Theatre, early in 1808 gave his lectures at the Royal
Institution, at the end of that year began his plan of <cite>The
Friend</cite>, which took him up till towards the end of 1809&mdash;in
1811 proposed to write for <cite>The Courier</cite> on a salary. Mr.
Stuart mentions that the Essays on the Spaniards were sent
in the end of 1809 by Mr. Coleridge, as some return for
sums he had expended on his account, not on his (Mr.
Stuart’s) solicitation. He says that Mr. C. wrote in <cite>The
Courier</cite> for his own convenience, his other literary projects
having failed, and that he wrote for it against the will of
Mr. Street, the Editor, who, in accepting his services, only
yielded to his (Mr. S.’s) suggestion. “<cite>The Courier</cite>,” he says,
“required no assistance. It was, and had long been, the
evening paper of the highest circulation.” In another letter,
dated 7th September 1835, he speaks thus: “<cite>The Courier</cite>
indeed sold 8000 daily for some years, but when Street and
I purchased it at a good price in June, 1799, it sold nearly
2000, and had the reputation of selling more. It was the
apostasy of <cite>The Sun</cite> in 1803, Street’s good management, its
early intelligence, and the importance of public events, that
raised <cite>The Courier</cite>.” In the same letter he says, “Could
Coleridge have written the leading paragraph daily his
services would have been invaluable, but an occasional essay
or two could produce little effect. It was early and ample
accounts of domestic occurrences, as Trials, Executions,
etc. etc., exclusively early Irish news; the earliest French
news; full Parliamentary Debates; Corn Riots in 1800;
Procession proclaiming Peace; the attack on the King by
Hatfield at the Theatre; the arrest of Arthur O’Connor,
respecting which I was examined at the Privy Council: it
was the earliest and fullest accounts of such things as these,
while the other papers were negligent, that raised <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> from 350, when I took it in August, 1795, to 4500,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_82" title="82"></a>
when I sold it in August, 1803, and then no other daily
morning paper sold above 3000. It was unremitting attention
and success in giving the best and earliest accounts of
occurrences that made <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, and not the
writings of any one, though good writing is always an important
feature. I have known the Paper served more by a
minute, picturesque, lively account of the ascension of a
balloon than ever it was by any piece of writing. There is a
great difference among newspapers in this respect. Most of
the Sunday Papers, calling themselves <em>News</em>papers, have no
news, only political essays, which are read by the working-classes,
and which in those papers produce astonishing success.”
In other letters he says: “The reputation of the
writings of any man, the mere reputation of them, would
not serve, or in the very slightest degree serve, any daily
newspaper.” “Mackintosh’s reputation as a political writer
was then much higher than that of Coleridge, and he was
my brother-in-law, known to have written for the Paper,
especially during one year (1795&ndash;6), and to be on good
terms with me, yet I must confess that even to the reputation
of his writing for the Paper I never ascribed any part of
its success.”</p>

<p>It does not appear from Mr. Stuart how many essays in
all Mr. Coleridge contributed to <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and <cite>The
Courier</cite>. Mr. C. himself mentions several in the tenth chapter
of the <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite>. All these have been copied,
and will be republished hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> I happen to possess also
his contributions to <cite>The Courier</cite> in 1811. They are numerous,
though not daily; which I have now no means of ascertaining.
The Critique on <cite>Bertram</cite> first appeared in that Paper, I
believe in 1816. Mr. Stuart admits that some of the poems
published by Mr. C. in <cite>The Morning Post</cite> before his going<a class="pagenum" id="Page_83" title="83"></a>
to Germany made a “great impression:” that on Mr. C.’s
proposing “personally on the spot and by daily exertion to
assist him in the conduct of the Paper,” he “grasped at the
engagement,” and “no doubt solicited” him “in the most
earnest manner to enter upon it;” that his “writings produced
a greater effect in <cite>The Morning Post</cite> than any others.”
In his letter of September 19, 1835, Mr. S. says “The most
remarkable things Coleridge published in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>
were <cite>The Devil’s Thoughts</cite> and the <cite>Character of Pitt</cite>. Each
of these made a sensation, which any writings unconnected
with the news of the day rarely did.” Elsewhere he says,
“Several hundred sheets extra were sold by them, and the
paper was in demand for days and weeks afterwards. Coleridge
promised a pair of portraits, Pitt and Buonaparte. I
could not walk a hundred yards in the streets but I was
stopped by inquiries, ‘When shall we have Buonaparte?’
One of the most eager of these inquirers was Dr. Moore,
author of <cite>Zeluco</cite>.” In the letter mentioned just above he
says “At one time Coleridge engaged to write daily for <cite>The
Courier</cite> on the news of the day, and he did attend very
regularly and wrote; but as it was in the spring, when the
Paper was overwhelmed with debates and advertisements
(and Street always preferring news, and a short notice of it
in a leading paragraph to any writing however brilliant,) little
or nothing that he wrote was inserted from want of room.
Of this he repeatedly complained to me, saying that he
would not continue to receive a salary without rendering
services. I answered, ‘Wait till Parliament is up; we shall
then have ample room, and shall be obliged to you for all
you can give us.’ When Parliament rose Coleridge disappeared,
or at least discontinued his services.”</p>

<p>The time here spoken of was in June, 1811. In April he
had proposed to Mr. Stuart a particular plan of writing for
<cite>The Courier</cite>, and on May 5, he writes to that gentleman,
that he had stated and particularized this proposal to Mr.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" title="84"></a>
Street, and “found a full and in all appearance a warm
assent.” Mr. Street, he says, “expressed himself highly
pleased both at the thought of my assistance in general, and
with the specific plan of assistance. There was no doubt, he
said, that it would be of great service to the Paper.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stuart has been offended by Mr. Coleridge’s saying
that he “employed the prime and manhood of his intellect
in these labours,” namely for the Papers; that they “added
nothing to his fortune or reputation;” that the “industry of
the week supplied the necessities of the week.” This he has
considered as a reproach to himself, and an unjust one. It
was not&mdash;Mr. Stuart himself saw that it was not&mdash;so intended;
Mr. Coleridge’s only object was to show that he had
not altogether suffered his talents to “rust away without
any efficient exertion for his own good or that of his fellow-creatures;”
that he had laboured more than would appear
from the number and size of the books he had produced,
and in whatever he wrote had aimed not merely to supply
his own temporal wants, but to benefit his readers by bringing
high principles in view. “For, while cabbage-stalks rot
on dunghills,” says he, in a letter<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to the late Editor of
<cite>The Morning Post</cite>, “I will never write what, or for what, I
do not think right. All that prudence can justify is not to
write what at certain times one may yet think.” But Mr.
Stuart thought that the Public would draw inferences from
Mr. C.’s language injurious to himself, though it was not
meant of him; and hence he gave the details which I have
thought it right to bring forward. I have no doubt that
Mr. Coleridge had an exaggerated impression of the amount
of his labours for <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and <cite>The Courier</cite>, and
that when he said that he had raised the sale of the former
from a low number to 7000 daily, he mistook the sale of the
latter, which, Mr. Stuart admits, may have been 7000 per<a class="pagenum" id="Page_85" title="85"></a>
day in 1811, when he wrote for it constantly, with that of
<cite>The Morning Post</cite>, which never sold above 4500. Mr. Stuart
says truly “Coleridge had a defective memory, from want of
interest in common things;” and of this he brings forward
a strong instance. I think my Father’s example and experience
go to prove that Newspaper reading must ever be
more or less injurious to the public mind; high and careful
writing for the daily journal will never answer: who could
furnish noble views and a refined moral commentary on
public events and occurrences every day of the week, or even
every other day, and obtain a <em>proportionate</em> recompense? On
the other hand, a coarse or low sort of writing on the important
subjects, with which the journal deals, must do mischief.
No one will deny that the character of Mr. C.’s
articles was such as he has described; he would naturally
be more alive to marks of the impression made by what he
wrote in particular than any one else, even the Editor; and
men are apt to judge of their labours by intensity as much
as by quantity. He perhaps expended more thought on
some of those essays, of which Mr. Street and even Mr.
Stuart thought lightly, than would have served to furnish a
large amount of ordinary serviceable matter. Mr. Stuart
observes, “He never had a prime and manhood of intellect
in the sense in which he speaks of it in the <cite>Lit. Biography</cite>.
He had indeed the great mind, the great powers, but he
could not use them for the press with regularity and vigour.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
He was always ill.” This may have been true; yet it was
during what ought to have been the best years of his life
that he wrote for the Papers, and doubtless what he did
produce helped to exhaust his scanty stock of bodily power,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_86" title="86"></a>
and to prevent him from writing as many books as he might
have done, had circumstances permitted him to use his pen,
not for procuring “the necessities of the week,” but in the
manner most congenial to his own mind, and ultimately
most useful to the public. “Such things as <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> and money,” says Mr. S., in <cite>The Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,
“never settled upon his mind.” I believe that such things
<em>unsettled</em> his mind, and made him, as the lampooner said,
with a somewhat different allusion, “Like to a man on
double business bound, who both neglects.” This was a
trouble to himself and all connected with him. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le ciel nous
vend toujours les biens qu’il nous prodigue</em>, may be applied to
my poor Father emphatically.</p>

<p>In regard to the remuneration he received, I do not bring
forward the <em>particulars</em> given by Mr. Stuart of his liberal
dealing with Mr. Coleridge, simply because the rehearsal of
them would be tedious, and could answer no end. Such
details may be superseded by the general declaration, that I
believe my Father to have received from Mr. Stuart far more
than the market value of his contributions to the Papers
which that gentleman was concerned in. Mr. Stuart says
that he “paid at the time as highly as such writings were
paid for,” and to Mr. Coleridge’s satisfaction, which my
Father’s own letters certainly testify; and concludes the
account of sums advanced by him to Mr. C., when he was
not writing for the paper, by saying that he had “at least
£700 of him beside many acts of kindness.” A considerable
part of this was spent on stamps and paper for <cite>The
Friend</cite>; two hundred of it was given after the publication of
the <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite>.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleridge expressed his esteem for Mr. Stuart and
sense of his kindness very strongly in letters to himself, but
not more strongly than to others. He speaks of him in a
letter written about the beginning of 1809, addressed to a
gentleman of the Quaker persuasion at Leeds, as “a man of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" title="87"></a>
the most consummate knowledge of the world, managed by
a thorough strong and sound judgment, and rendered innocuous
by a good heart”&mdash;as a “most wise, disinterested,
kind, and constant friend.” In a letter to my Mother, written
on his return from Malta, he says, “Stuart is a friend, and
a friend indeed.”</p>

<p>I have thought it right to bring forward these particulars,&mdash;(I
and those equally concerned with myself)&mdash;not only
out of a regard to truth and openness, that the language of
this work respecting <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and <cite>The Courier</cite>
may not be interpreted in any way contrary to fact, which,
I think, it <em>need</em> not be; but also in gratitude to a man who
was serviceable and friendly to my Father during many years
of his life; who appreciated his merits as a prose writer when
they were not generally known and acknowledged; and by
whose aid his principal prose work, <cite>The Friend</cite>, was brought
before the public. I do not complain in the least of his
stating the facts of my Father’s newspaper writings; in the
<em>manner</em> in which this was done&mdash;as was pointed out at the
time&mdash;there <em>was</em> something to complain of. Let me add that
I consider his representation of my Father’s feelings on certain
occasions altogether incredible, and deeply regret these
pieces of bad construing, dictated by resentment, in one who
was once so truly his friend.</p>

<p>My Father certainly does not assert, as Mr. Stuart represents
him as having asserted in the <cite>Literary Biography</cite>, that
he “made the fortunes of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> and <cite>The
Courier</cite>, and was inadequately paid.” He speaks of his writings
as having been in furtherance of <em>Government</em>. I have
no doubt he thought that they were serviceable to Government
and to his country, and that while they brought upon
him the enmity of the anti-ministerial and Buonapartean
party, and every possible hindrance to his literary career
which the most hostile and contemptuous criticism of a leading
journal could effect, they were unrewarded in any other<a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" title="88"></a>
quarter. There was truth in one half of Hazlitt’s sarcasm,
“his politics turned&mdash;<em>but not to account</em>.” “From Government,
or the friends of Government!” says Mr. Stuart,
“Why, Coleridge was attacking Pitt and Lord Grenville in
1800, who were at the head of the Government. In 1801,
when the Addingtons came into power, he wrote little or
nothing in <cite>The Morning Post</cite>; in the autumn of 1802 he
wrote one or two able essays against Buonaparte in relation
to the Peace of Amiens, and he published in that paper, at
that time, a letter or two to Judge Fletcher.” This last sentence
is a double mistake, as I have already shown. “At
that time the newspaper press generally condemned the
conduct of Buonaparte in the severest manner: and no part
of it more severely than <cite>The Morning Post</cite> by my own writings.
Cobbett attacked Fox, etc., but <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was
the most distinguished on this subject, and the increase of
its circulation was great. The qualified opposition to
Government was not given to Pitt’s ministry, but to Addington’s.
To Pitt <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was always, in my time,
decidedly opposed. I supported Addington against Buonaparte,
during the Peace of Amiens, with all my power, and
in the summer of 1803 Mr. Estcourt came to me with a
message of thanks from the prime minister, Mr. A. offering
anything I wished. I declined the offer. It was not till the
summer of 1804, a year after I had finally left <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> that, in <cite>The Courier</cite>, I supported Pitt against Buonaparte,
on the same grounds I had supported Mr. Addington,
Pitt having become again prime minister, to protect Lord
Melville against the fifth clause. Coleridge confuses things.
The qualified support of the ministry, he alludes to, applies
wholly to <cite>The Courier</cite>.” I do not see the material discrepancy
between this statement and my Father’s, when he says
that <cite>The Morning Post</cite> was “<em>anti-ministerial</em>, indeed, but
with far greater earnestness and zeal, both anti-jacobin and
anti-gallican,” and that it proved a far more useful ally to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" title="89"></a>
the Government in its most important objects, in consequence
of its being generally considered moderately <em>anti-ministerial</em>,
than if it had been the avowed eulogist of <em>Mr.</em> Pitt; “that
the rapid increase in the sale of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> is a pledge
that genuine impartiality with a respectable portion of literary
talent will secure the success of a newspaper <em>without ministerial
patronage</em>,” and that from “the <em>commencement of the
Addington administration</em>” whatever he himself had written
“in <cite>The Morning Post</cite> or <cite>Courier</cite> was in defence of Government.”
In the preceding paragraph he argues that neither
Mr. Percival nor “the present administration” pursued the
plans of Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>In what degree my Father’s writings contributed to the
reputation and success of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> cannot at this
distance of time be <em>precisely</em> settled. It must indeed be
difficult to say what occasions success in such enterprises,
if Mr. Stuart’s own brother could attribute that of <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> to Sir James Mackintosh, “though with less reason
even than if he had ascribed it to Coleridge.” The long story
told to show that booksellers were not aware of Mr. C.’s
having produced any effect on the paper, and when they set
up a rival journal, never cared to obtain his services, but
eagerly secured those of Mr. Stuart’s assistant, George Lane,
does not quite decide the question; for booksellers, though,
as Mr. Stuart says, “knowing men” in such matters, are not
<em>omniscient</em> even in what concerns their own business. If the
anti-gallican policy of <cite>The Morning Post</cite> “increased its
circulation,” I cannot but think that the influence of my
Father’s writings,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> though not numerous, and indirectly of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" title="90"></a>
his intercourse with the Editor,&mdash;who rates his conversational
powers as highly as it is usual to rate them&mdash;in directing the
tone and determining the principles of the paper, must have
served it materially. I believe him to have been the anti-gallican
<em>spirit</em> that governed <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, though he
may not have performed as much of the <em>letter</em> as he fancied.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this subject with quoting part of a letter
of my Father’s on the subject of <cite>The Courier</cite>, to which
Mr. Stuart, to whom it was addressed, declares himself to
have replied, that “as long as he actively interfered, the
Paper was conducted on the independent principles alluded
to by Coleridge,” but that, for reasons which he states, he
found it best, from the year 1811, to “leave Street entirely
to his own course;” and “so it gradually slid into a mere
ministerial journal&mdash;an instrument of the Treasury:” “acquired
a high character for being the organ of Government,
and obtained a great circulation; but became odious to the
mob&mdash;excited by the falsehoods of the weekly journals.”</p>

<div class="pad5">Wednesday, 8th May, 1816.</div>
James Gillman’s, Esq., Surgeon,
<div class="pad15">Highgate.</div>
</div>

<p>My dear Stuart,</p>

<p>Since you left me, I have been reflecting a great deal
on the subject of the Catholic question, and somewhat on<a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" title="91"></a>
<cite>The Courier</cite> in general. With all my weight of <em>faults</em>, (and
no one is less likely to underrate them than myself), a
tendency to be influenced by selfish motives in my
friendships, or even in the cultivation of my acquaintance,
will not, I am sure, be by <em>you</em> placed among them. When
we first knew each other, it was perhaps the most interesting
period of both our lives, at the very turn of the flood; and
I can never cease to reflect with affectionate delight on the
steadiness and independence of your conduct and principles,
and how, for so many years, with little assistance from others,
and with one main guide, a sympathizing tact for the real
sense, feeling, and impulses of the <em>respectable</em> part of the
English nation, you went on so auspiciously, and likewise
so <em>effectively</em>. It is far, very far, from being an hyperbole to
affirm, that you did more against the French scheme of
Continental domination than the Duke of Wellington has
done; or rather, Wellington could neither have been supplied
by the Ministers, nor the Ministers supported by the nation,
but for the tone first given, and then constantly kept up by
the plain, un-ministerial, anti-opposition, anti-Jacobin, anti-Gallican,
anti-Napoleon spirit of your writings, aided by a
colloquial style and evident good sense, in which, as acting
on an immense mass of knowledge of existing men and
existing circumstances, you are superior to any man I ever
met with in my life-time. Indeed you are the only human
being, of whom I can say with severe truth, that I never
conversed with you for an hour without rememberable instruction;
and with the same simplicity I dare affirm my
belief, that my greater knowledge of <em>man</em> has been useful to
you, though, from the nature of things, not so useful as your
knowledge of <em>men</em> has been to me.</p>

<p>Now, with such convictions, my dear Stuart, how is it
possible that I can look back on the conduct of <cite>The Courier</cite>,
from the period of the Duke of York’s restoration, without
some pain? You cannot be seriously offended or affronted<a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" title="92"></a>
with me, if, in this deep confidence and in a letter, which,
or its contents, can meet no eye but your own, I venture to
declare, that though since then much has been done, very
much of high utility to the country, by and under Mr. Street,
yet <cite>The Courier</cite> itself has gradually lost that sanctifying spirit
which was the life of its life, and without which, even the
best and soundest principles lose half their effect on the
human mind; I mean, the faith in the <em>faith</em> of the person
and paper which brings them forward. They are attributed
to the <em>accident</em> of their happening to be for such a side, or
for such a party. In short, there is no longer any <em>root</em> in the
paper, out of which all the various branches and fruits, and
even fluttering leaves, are seen or believed to grow. But it
is the old tree, barked round above the root, though the
circular decortication is so small and so neatly filled up and
coloured as to be scarcely visible but in its effects, excellent
fruit still hanging on the boughs, but they are tied on by
threads and hairs.</p>

<p>In all this I am well aware, that you are no otherwise to
be blamed than in permitting that which without disturbance
to your heart and tranquillity, you could not, perhaps, have
prevented or effectively modified. But the whole plan of
Street seems to me to have been motiveless from the beginning,
or at least affected by the grossest miscalculations, in
respect even of pecuniary interests. For, had the paper
maintained and asserted not only its independence, but its
appearance of it;&mdash;it is true that Mr. Street might not have
had Mr. A. to dine with him, or received as many nods and
shakes of the hand from Lord this or that; but at least
equally true, that the ministry would have been far more
effectively served, and that (I speak from facts), both the
paper and its conductor would have been held by the
adherents of ministers in far higher respect; and after all,
ministers do not <em>love</em> newspapers in their hearts, not even
those that support them; indeed it seems epidemic among<a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" title="93"></a>
Parliament men in general to affect to look down upon and
despise newspapers, to which they owe <sup>999</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> of their influence
and character, and at least <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>ths of their knowledge and phraseology.
Enough! burn the letter, and forgive the writer, for
the purity and affectionateness of his motive.”&mdash;Quoted from
the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> of June, 1838.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>One other point connected with Mr. C.’s writings for
public journals I must advert to before concluding this
chapter. Mr. Cottle finds want of memory in some part of
the narrative, contained in this work, respecting the publication
of <cite>The Watchman</cite>; it is as well to let him tell the story
in his own way, which he does as follows. “The plain fact
is, I purchased the whole of the paper for <cite>The Watchman</cite>,
allowing Mr. C. to have it at prime cost, and receiving
small sums from Mr. C. occasionally, in liquidation. I became
responsible, also, with Mr. B. for printing the work,
by which means, I reduced the price per sheet, as a bookseller
(1000), from fifty shillings to thirty-five shillings. Mr.
C. paid me for the paper in fractions, as he found it convenient,
but from the imperfection of Mr. Coleridge’s own
receipts I never received the whole. It was a losing concern
altogether, and I was willing, and did bear, uncomplaining,
my portion of the loss. There is some difference between
this statement, and that of Mr. Coleridge, in his <cite>Biographia
Literaria</cite>. A defect of memory must have existed, arising
out of the lapse of twenty-two years; but my notices, made
at the time, did not admit of mistake. There were but twenty
sheets in the whole ten numbers of <cite>The Watchman</cite>, which,
at thirty-five shillings per sheet, came to only thirty-five
pounds. The paper amounted to much more than the
printing.</p>

<p>“I cannot refrain from observing further, that my loss was
augmented from another cause. Mr. C. states in the above<a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" title="94"></a>
work, that his London publisher never paid him ‘one farthing,’
but ‘set him at defiance.’ I also was more than his
equal companion in this misfortune. The thirty copies of
Mr. C.’s poems, and the six ‘<em>Joans of Arc</em>’ (referred to in
the preceding letter)<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> found a ready sale, by this said
‘indefatigable London publisher,’ and large and fresh orders
were received, so that Mr. Coleridge and myself successively
participated in two very opposite sets of feeling; the one of
exultation that our publications had found <em>so good a sale</em>;
and the other of <em>depression</em>, that the time of <em>payment</em> never
arrived!”</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing my sense of many
kind acts and much friendly conduct of Mr. Cottle towards
my Father, often spoken of to me by my dear departed
Mother, into whose heart all benefits sank deep, and by
whom he was ever remembered with respect and affection.
If I still regard with any disapproval his publication of letters
exposing his friend’s unhappy bondage to opium and
consequent embarrassments and deep distress of mind, it is
not that I would have wished a broad influencive fact in the
history of one whose peculiar gifts had made him in some
degree an object of public interest, to be finally concealed,
supposing it to be attested, as this has been, by clear unambiguous
documents. I agree with Mr. Cottle in thinking
that he would himself have desired, even to the last, that
whatever benefit the world might obtain by the knowledge
of his sufferings from opium,&mdash;the calamity which the <em>unregulated</em>
use of this drug had been to him&mdash;into which he
first fell ignorantly and innocently, (not as Mr. De Quincey
has said, to restore the “riot of his animal spirits,” when
“youthful blood no longer sustained it,” but as a relief from
bodily pain and nervous irritation)&mdash;that others might avoid
the rock, on which so great a part of his happiness for so<a class="pagenum" id="Page_95" title="95"></a>
long a time was wrecked; and this from the same benevolent
feeling, which prompted him earnestly to desire that his
body should be opened after his death, in the hope that some
cause of his life-long pains in the region of the bowels might
be discovered, and that the knowledge thus obtained might
lead to the invention of a remedy for like afflictions. Such
a wish indeed, on the former point, as well as afterwards on
the latter, he once strongly expressed; but I believe myself
to be speaking equally in his spirit when I say, that all such
considerations of advantage to the public should be subordinated
to the prior claims of private and natural interests.
My own opinion is, that it is the wiser and better plan for
persons connected with those, whose feats of extraordinary
strength have drawn the public gaze upon them, to endure
patiently that their frailties should be gazed and wondered
at too; and even if they think, that any reflection to them of
such celebrity, on such conditions, is far more to be deprecated
than desired, still to consider that they are not permitted
to determine their lot, in this respect, but are to take
it as it has been determined for them, independently of their
will, with its peculiar pains and privileges annexed to it. I
believe that most of them would be like the sickly queen in
the fairy tale of Peronella, who repented when she had obtained
the country maiden’s youth and health at the loss of
rank and riches. Be this as it may, they have not a choice
of evils, nor can exchange the aches and pains of their portion,
or its wrinkles and blemishes,&mdash;for a fair and painless
obscurity. These remarks, however, refer only to the feeling
and conduct of parties privately affected by such exposures.
Others are bound to care for them as they are not bound to
care for themselves. If a finished portrait of one, in whom
they are nearly concerned, is due to the world, they alone
can be the debtors, for the property by inheritance is in
them. Other persons, without their leave, should not <em>undertake</em>
to give any such portrait; <em>their</em> duties move on a differ<a class="pagenum" id="Page_96" title="96"></a>ent
plane; nor can they rightly feel themselves “entitled”
(to borrow the language of Mr. De Quincey, while I venture
to dissent from his judgment), “to notice the most striking
aspects of his character, of his disposition and his manners,
as so many reflex indications of his intellectual constitution,”
if this involves the publication of letters on private subjects,
the relation of domestic circumstances and other such personalities
affecting the living. I am sure at least that conscience
would prohibit <em>me</em> from any such course. I should
never think the public good a sufficient apology for publishing
the secret history of any man or woman whatever, who
had connections remaining upon earth; but if I were possessed
of private notices respecting one in whom the world
takes an interest, should think it right to place them in
the hands of his nearest relations, leaving it to them to
deal with such documents, as a sense of what is due to
the public, and what belongs to openness and honesty, may
demand.</p>

<p class="p2">Of all the censors of Mr. Coleridge, Mr. De Quincey is the
one whose remarks are the most worthy of attention; those
of the rest in general are but views taken from a distance,
and filled up by conjecture, views taken through a medium
so thick with <em>opinion</em>, even if not clouded with vanity and
self-love, that it resembles a horn more than glass or the
transpicuous air;&mdash;The Opium eater, as he has called himself,
had sufficient inward sympathy with the subject of his
criticism to be capable in some degree of beholding his mind,
as it actually existed, in all the intermingling shades of individual
reality; and in few minds have these shades been
more subtly intermingled than in my Father’s. But Mr. De
Quincey’s portrait of Coleridge is not the man himself; for
besides that his knowledge of what concerned him outwardly
was imperfect, the inward sympathy of which I have
spoken was far from entire, and he has written as if it were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_97" title="97"></a>
greater than it really was. I cannot but conjecture, from
what he has disclosed concerning himself, that on some
points he has seen Mr. Coleridge’s mind <em>too much</em> in the
mirror of his own. His sketches of my Father’s life and
character are, like all that he writes, so finely written, that
the blots on the narrative are the more to be deplored. One
of these blots is the passage to which I referred at the beginning
of the last paragraph: “I believe it to be notorious
that he first began the use of opium, not as a relief from any
bodily pains or nervous irritations&mdash;for his constitution was
strong and excellent&mdash;but as a source of luxurious sensations.
It is a great misfortune, at least it is a great pain, to
have tasted the enchanted cup of youthful rapture incident
to the poetic temperament. Coleridge, to speak in the words
of <em>Cervantes</em>, wanted better bread than was made with wheat.”
Mr. De Quincey mistook a constitution that had vigour in it
for a vigorous constitution. His body was originally full of
life, but it was full of death also from the first; there was in
him a slow poison, which gradually leavened the whole lump,
and by which his muscular frame was prematurely slackened
and stupified. Mr. Stuart says that his letters are “one continued
flow of complaint of ill health and incapacity from
ill health.” This is true of all his letters&mdash;(all the <em>sets</em> of
them)&mdash;which have come under my eye, even those written
before he went to Malta, where his opium habits were confirmed.
Indeed it was in search of health that he visited the
Mediterranean,&mdash;for one in his condition of nerves a most
ill-advised measure,&mdash;I believe that the climate of South
Italy is poison to most persons who suffer from relaxation
and tendency to low fever. If my Father sought more from
opium than the mere absence of pain, I feel assured that
it was not luxurious sensations or the glowing phantasmagoria
of passive dreams; but that the power of the
medicine might keep down the agitations of his nervous
system, like a strong hand grasping the jangled strings of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" title="98"></a>
some shattered lyre,&mdash;that he might once more lightly flash
along</p>

<span class="subtitle">MRS. COLERIDGE. LAST STAY AT THE LAKE DISTRICT</span></h2>

<p>[Coleridge married Sarah Fricker, as we have already
seen, on 5th October, 1795. The first period of
Coleridge’s married life had been a happy one. Although
there is reason to believe Coleridge married his wife to
“heal a deeper wound,” and that Mary Evans would have
been the object of his choice, there is no reason to suppose
that he ever regretted his union with Sarah Fricker during the
first years of their marriage. All accounts we have of the
Clevedon and Stowey periods agree that Coleridge was happy
in the new domestic bond. Cottle prints a glowing picture
of the life at Clevedon (<cite>Reminiscences</cite>);<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and Richard Reynell
concurs regarding the Stowey cottage life (<cite>Illustrated London
News</cite>, 1893). Coleridge, too, wrote most affectionately
to his wife during his absence in Germany (<cite>Letters</cite>), and he
was a deep lover of his children, and always in dread lest
any calamity should happen to them while he was in Germany
and Malta (<cite>Letters</cite>). Coleridge, above most men, was
peculiarly fitted to make a good husband. He never spoke
of his wife as his intellectual inferior, although he knew
perfectly well she was not fitted to follow him in his Platonic
imaginings. Dorothy Wordsworth’s remarks (<cite>Coleorton Memorials</cite>,
p. 164) on this point are beside the mark. Coleridge
never expected to find in the woman he was prepared to love<a class="pagenum" id="Page_101" title="101"></a>
intellectual grasp of his philosophic system. The woman
ideals he has given us are not blue-stockings, but domestic
Ophelias and Imogens. Read in this connection <cite>The Eolian
Harp</cite> and <cite>Lines written on having left a Place of Retirement</cite>,
<cite>Lewti</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>, <cite>Love</cite>, <cite>Fears in Solitude</cite>, the <cite>Day Dream</cite>.
“I could,” said Coleridge to Thomas Allsop in 1822, “have
been happy with a servant-girl had she only in sincerity of
heart responded to my affection.” (Allsop’s <cite>Letters of S. T.
Coleridge</cite>, p. 206.)</p>

<p>Strained relations commenced to develop between the
poet and Mrs. Coleridge between the summer of 1801 and the
summer of 1802; and that Coleridge was not living happily
with his wife began to leak out among their acquaintances
during 1802; and by 1807 it had become a recognized fact.
The evidence of all this does not require to be quoted to those
who have read the <cite>Journals</cite> and Letters of Dorothy Wordsworth.
There are numerous notices of the estrangement, and
Dorothy in a letter to Lady Beaumont (<cite>Coleorton Memorials</cite>, i,
162), enumerates what she supposes were the causes of the
gulf of separation.</p>

<p>The causes of the estrangement were cumulative. While
Coleridge never looked upon his wife as his inferior, and
never expected attainments in her which she did not have,
Mrs. Coleridge, as she advanced in years, could not be slow
to perceive that there were other women beside herself who
deeply interested themselves in her husband with his conversational
fascinations and gentlemanly bearing toward
woman. She could not be oblivious to the fact that Dorothy
Wordsworth, for instance, was intellectually better fitted than
herself to comprehend the “large discourse” which characterized
Coleridge; and into Dorothy’s ear was poured
many a transcendental disquisition not understandable by
the wife. Very few wives, as we know from the Carlyle history,
can allow their husbands to have a “Gloriana;” and it
is not likely that Sarah Fricker was one of the exceptions.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" title="102"></a>
Later, Charlotte Brent became one of Coleridge’s Platonic
sisterhood, but of what intellectual capacity she was of
we cannot tell. But she added to the wife’s resentment.
Opium, too, of course, had its share in irritating the discontented
wife.</p>

<p>There is little foundation, as far as I can see, for the
charge made against Mrs. Coleridge in Flagg’s <cite>Life of Allston</cite>,
p. 356, that Mrs. Coleridge had a horrible and ungovernable
temper. I think ill-temper was created by events and
by the non-success of Coleridge, and by the unfavourable
comparison Coleridge as a literary man made with Southey,
who was luckily successful in his ventures while Coleridge
was always unfortunate. She was doubtless sorely tried.</p>

<p>It must also be stated that Coleridge did not neglect his
wife in the pecuniary sense. He allowed Mrs. Coleridge to
enjoy the whole of the Wedgwood Pension (less £20 a year
which he granted to her mother, Mrs. Fricker).<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In his
brief bursts of prosperity he also remitted her supplementary
sums, £110 was sent from Malta, and £100 more promised.
When <cite>Remorse</cite> was a success he sent her £100, on 20th
January 1813 (<cite>Letters</cite>, 603), and another £100 was promised
in a month. Coleridge also effected an insurance on his life
for £1,000, with profits, before going to Malta, the premium
for which was £27 5<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per annum. This was paid to
the end of his life, sometimes, no doubt, by the help of
friends; and the policy realized £2,560. The charge, therefore,
that Coleridge neglected or deserted his wife and
family is without foundation. Stuart, in an article otherwise
by no means favourable to Coleridge, acquits him on this
charge. He says Coleridge “never deserted them in the
sense which the words imply. On the contrary, he always
spoke of them to me with esteem, affection, and anxiety. He
allowed to them the greatest part of his income, but that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" title="103"></a>
was sometimes insufficient for their comfortable subsistence,
and he himself was usually more distressed for money than
they;” (<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, 1838). We may add that
Coleridge was a man of a vestal purity; and, in spite of his
own experience, never said anything in disparagement of the
marriage bond.</p>

<p>Coleridge paid his last visit to the Lake District in the
spring of 1812, 23rd February to 26th March (<cite>Letters</cite>, 575).
He quitted his wife on cordial enough terms, and wrote an
agreeable letter to her from London (<cite>Letters</cite>, 579), of date
21st April. But he never returned to Keswick. That mysterious
gulf which he has described so wonderfully and
weirdly in <cite>Christabel</cite> which separates sundered hearts,
widened with the years; and</p>

<p class="center">They stood aloof, the scars remaining!</p>

<p class="quote">By what I <em>have</em> effected, am I to be judged by my fellow-men; what
I <em>could</em> have done is a question for my own conscience.&mdash;S. T. C.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite> does not mention all Mr.
Coleridge’s writings, it will be proper to give some
account of them here.</p>

<p>The Poetical Works in three volumes include the <cite>Juvenile
Poems</cite>, <cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite>, <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>, <cite>Remorse</cite>,
<cite>Zapolya</cite>, and <cite>Wallenstein</cite>.</p>

<p>The first volume of <cite>Juvenile Poems</cite> was published in the
Spring of 1796. It contains three sonnets by Charles Lamb,
and a poetical Epistle which he called “Sara’s,” but of
which my Mother told me she wrote but little. Indeed it is
not very like some simple affecting verses, which were
wholly by herself, on the death of her beautiful infant,
Berkeley, in 1799. In May, 1797, Mr. C. put forth a collection
of poems, containing all that were in his first edition,
with the exception of twenty pieces and the addition of ten
new ones and a considerable number by his friends, Lloyd
and Lamb. <cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Love</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> <cite>The Nightingale</cite>,
<cite>The Foster Mother’s Tale</cite> first appeared with the <cite>Lyrical
Ballads</cite> of Mr. Wordsworth in the summer of 1798. There
was a third edition of the <cite>Juvenile Poems</cite> by themselves in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" title="105"></a>
1803, with the original motto from Statius, <cite>Felix curarum</cite>,
etc. <cite>Silo. Lib.</cite> iv. A spirit of almost child-like sociability
seemed to reign among these young poets&mdash;they were fond
of joint publications.</p>

<p><cite>Wallenstein</cite>, a Play translated from the German of Schiller,
appeared in 1800. <cite>Christabel</cite> was not published till
April 1816, but written, the first part at Stowey in 1797, the
second at Keswick in 1800. It went into a third edition in
the first year. The fragment called <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, composed
in 1797,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the <cite>Pains of Sleep</cite>, which was annexed to the
former by way of contrast, were published with the first
edition of <cite>Christabel</cite>, in 1816.</p>

<p>The Tragedy called <cite>Remorse</cite> was written in the summer
and autumn of 1797, but not represented on the stage till
1813, when it was performed at Drury Lane&mdash;on the authority
of an old play-bill of the Calne Theatre, “with unbounded
applause thirty successive nights.” On “the success
of the <cite>Remorse</cite>,” Mr. Coleridge wrote thus to his friend
Mr. Poole, on the 14th of February, 1813:</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_152"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 152.</span></h3>

<p>“The receipt of your heart-engendered lines was sweeter
than an unexpected strain of sweetest music;&mdash;or in humbler
phrase, it was the only pleasurable sensation which the <em>success
of the Remorse</em> has given me. I have read of, or perhaps
only imagined, a punishment in Arabia, in which the culprit
was so bricked up as to be unable to turn his eyes to the
right or to the left, while in front was placed a high heap of
barren sand glittering under the vertical sun. Some slight
analogue of this, I have myself suffered from the mere unusualness
of having my attention forcibly directed to a sub<a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" title="106"></a>ject
which permitted neither sequence of imagery, nor series
of reasoning. No grocer’s apprentice, after his first month’s
permitted riot, was ever sicker of figs and raisins than I of
hearing about the <cite>Remorse</cite>. The endless rat-a-tat-tat at our
black-and-blue bruised door, and my three master fiends,
proof sheets, letters (for I have a raging epistolophobia),
and worse than these&mdash;invitations to large dinners, which I
cannot refuse without offence and imputation of pride, nor
accept without disturbance of temper the day before, and a
sick aching stomach for two days after&mdash;oppress me so that
my spirits quite sink under it.</p>

<p>“I have never seen the Play since the first night. It has
been a good thing for the Theatre. They will get £8,000 or
£10,000 by it, and I shall get more than all my literary
labours put together, nay, thrice as much, subtracting my
heavy losses in <cite>The Watchman</cite> and <cite>The Friend</cite>, including
the copyright.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The manuscript of the <cite>Remorse</cite>, immediately after it was
written, was shown to Mr. Sheridan, “who,” says my Father,
in the Preface to the first Edition, “by a twice conveyed
recommendation (in the year 1797) had urged me to write a
Tragedy for his theatre, who, on my objection that I was
utterly ignorant of all stage tactics, had promised that <em>he</em>
would himself make the necessary alterations, if the piece
should be at all representable.” He however neither gave
him any answer, nor returned him the manuscript, which he
suffered to wander about the town from his house, and my
Father goes on to say, “not only asserted that the Play was
rejected because I would not submit to the alteration of one
ludicrous line, but finally, in the year 1806, amused and
delighted (as who was ever in his society, if I may trust the
universal report, without being amused and delighted?) a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_107" title="107"></a>
large company at the house of a highly respectable Member
of Parliament, with the ridicule of the Tragedy, as a <em>fair
specimen</em> of the <em>whole</em> of which he adduced a line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Drip! drip! drip!</div>
    <div class="line">There’s nothing here but dripping.</div>

</div>

<p>In the original copy of the Play, in the first scene of the
fourth act, Isidore <em>had</em> commenced his soliloquy in the
cavern with the words:</p>

<p class="center">Drip! drip! a ceaseless sound of water-drops,&mdash;</p>

<p>as far as I can at present recollect: for, on the possible
ludicrous association being pointed out to me, I instantly
and thankfully struck out the line.” I repeat this story as
told by Mr. C. himself, because it has been otherwise told
by others. I have little doubt that it was more pointedly
than faithfully told to him, and can never believe that Mr. S.
represented a ludicrous line as a fair specimen of the whole
Play, or his tenacious adherence to it as the reason for its
rejection. I dare say he thought it, as Lord Byron afterwards
thought <cite>Zapolya</cite>, “beautiful but not practicable.”
Mr. Coleridge felt that <em>he</em> had some claim to a friendly spirit
of criticism in that quarter, because he had “devoted the
firstlings of his talents,” as he says in a marginal note, “to
the celebration of Sheridan’s genius,”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and after the treatment
described “not only never spoke unkindly or resentfully
of it, but actually was zealous and frequent in defending
and praising his public principles and conduct in the
<cite>Morning Post</cite>”&mdash;of which, perhaps, Mr. S. knew nothing.
However, in lighter moods, my Father laughed at Sheridan’s
joke as much as any of his auditors could have done in
1806, and repeated with great effect and mock solemnity
“Drip!&mdash;Drip!&mdash;Drip!&mdash;nothing but dripping.” I suppose<a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" title="108"></a>
it was at this time,&mdash;the winter of 1806&ndash;7&mdash;that he made
an unsuccessful attempt to bring out the Tragedy at Drury
Lane.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>When first written this Play had been called <cite>Osorio</cite>, from
the principal character, whose name my Father afterwards
improved into <cite>Ordonio</cite>. I believe he in some degree altered,
if he did not absolutely recast, the three last acts after the
failure with Mr. Sheridan, who probably led him to see their
unfitness for theatrical representation.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But of this point I
have not certain knowledge. It was when Drury Lane was
under the management of Lord Byron and Mr. Whitbread,
and through the influence of the former, that it was produced
upon the stage. Mr. Gillman says, “Although Mr.
Whitbread did not give it the advantage of a single new
scene, yet the popularity of the Play was such, that the
principal actor, (Mr. Roe,) who had performed in it with
great success, made choice of it for his benefit night, and it
brought an overflowing house.” This was some time after
Mr. Coleridge took up his residence at Highgate, in April,
1816. After all I am happy to think that this drama is a
strain of <em>poetry</em>, and like all, not only dramatic poems, but
highly poetic dramas, not to be fully appreciated on the
stage.</p>

<p><cite>Zapolya</cite> came before the public in 1817. The stage fate
of this piece is alluded to in the <cite>B. L.</cite> Mr. Gillman mentions
that it was Mr. Douglas Kinnaird, then the critic for
Drury Lane, who rejected the Play, and complained of its
“metaphysics”&mdash;a term which is not, upon all occasions, to
be strictly construed, but, when used in familiar talk, seems
merely to denote whatever is too fine-spun, in the texture of
thought and speech, for common wear; whatever is not
readily apprehensible and generally acceptable. Schoolboys<a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" title="109"></a>
call everything in books or discourse, which is graver or
tenderer than they like, “<em>metaphysics</em>.” Mr. Kinnaird may
have judged quite rightly that the Play was too <em>metaphysical</em>
for our theatres in their present state, though certainly
plays as metaphysical were once well received on the stage.
<cite>Zapolya</cite>, however, had a favourable audience from the public
as a dramatic poem. Mr. Gillman says this Christmas Tale,
which the author “never sat down to write, but dictated
while walking up and down the room, became so immediately
popular that 2,000 copies were sold in six weeks.”</p>

<p>The collection of poems entitled <cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite>, “in
allusion to the fragmentary and widely scattered state in
which they had been long suffered to remain,” appeared in
1817, about the same time with <cite>Zapolya</cite>, the <cite>Biographia
Literaria</cite>, and the first <cite>Lay Sermon</cite>.</p>

<p>The <cite>Miscellaneous Poems</cite> were composed at different
periods of the author’s life, many of them in his later
years. I believe that <cite>Youth and Age</cite> was written before he
left the North of England in 1810,<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> when he was about
seven or eight-and-thirty,&mdash;early indeed for the poet to say
of himself</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">I see these locks in silvery slips,</div>
    <div class="line">This drooping gait, this altered size:</div>
    <div class="line">But spring-tide blossoms on thy lips,</div>
    <div class="line">And tears take sunshine from thine eyes.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The whole of the <cite>Poetical Works</cite>, with the exception of a
few which must be incorporated in a future edition, are contained
in that in three volumes.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> <cite>The Fall of Robespierre</cite>,
an Historic drama, of which the first act was written by
Mr. Coleridge, and published September 22, 1794, is
printed in the first vol. of the <cite>Lit. Remains</cite>. This first act
contains the Song on <cite>Domestic Peace</cite>. In the blank verse
there are some faint dawnings of his maturer style, as in
these lines:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" title="110"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The winged hours, that scatter’d roses round me,</div>
    <div class="line">Languid and sad, drag their slow course along,</div>
    <div class="line">And shake big gall-drops from their heavy wings&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and in these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Why, thou hast been the mouth-piece of all horrors,</div>
    <div class="line">And, like a blood-hound, crouch’d for murder! Now</div>
    <div class="line">Aloof thou standest from the tottering pillar,</div>
    <div class="line">Or, like a frighted child behind its mother,</div>
    <div class="line">Hidest thy pale face in the skirts of&mdash;<em>Mercy</em>!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but it contains scarcely anything of his peculiar original
powers, and some of the lines are in schoolboy taste; for
instance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">While sorrow sad, like the dank willow near her,</div>
    <div class="line">Hangs o’er the troubled fountain of her eye.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yet three years after the date of this composition, in 1797,
which has been called his <em>Annus Mirabilis</em>, he had reached
his poetical zenith. But perhaps it may be said that, from
original temperament, and the excitement of circumstances,
my Father lived fast.</p>

<p>He had four poetical epochs, which represented, in some
sort, boyhood, youthful manhood, middle age, and the decline
of life. The first commenced a little on this side
childhood, when he wrote <cite>Time real and Imaginary</cite>, and
ended in 1796. This period embraces the Juvenile Poems,
concluding with <cite>Religious Musings</cite>, written on the Christmas
Eve of 1794, a few months after <cite>The Fall of Robespierre</cite>:
<cite>The Destiny of Nations</cite> was composed a little earlier.
<cite>Lewti</cite>, written in 1795, <cite>The Æolian Harp</cite>, and <cite>Reflections
on having left a place of Retirement</cite>, written soon after, are
more finished poems, and exhibit more of his peculiar vein
than any which he wrote before them; though one poet, Mr.
Bowles, has said that he never surpassed the <cite>Religious
Musings</cite>! <cite>Fire, Famine, and Slaughter</cite> belongs to 1796.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" title="111"></a>
<cite>The Lines to a Friend</cite> (Charles Lamb) <em>who had declared his
intention of writing no more poetry</em>, and those <cite>To a Young
Friend</cite> (Charles Lloyd) were composed in the same year.
These poems of 1794&ndash;5-6 may be considered intermediate in
power as in time, and so forming a link between the first
epoch and the next.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Then came his poetic prime, which commenced with the
<cite>Ode to the Departing Year</cite>, composed at the end of December,
1796. The year following, the five-and-twentieth of his
life, produced the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Love</cite>, and <cite>The Dark
Ladie</cite>, the first part of <cite>Christabel</cite>, <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, <cite>Remorse</cite>, in
its original cast, <cite>France</cite>, and <cite>This Lime-tree bower</cite>. <cite>Fears in
Solitude</cite>, <cite>The Nightingale</cite>, and <cite>The Wanderings of Cain</cite>,
were written in 1798. <cite>Frost at Midnight</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> <cite>The Picture</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the
<cite>Lines to the Rev. G. Coleridge</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and those <cite>To W. Wordsworth</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
are all of this same Stowey period. It was in June, 1797,
that my Father began to be intimate with Mr. Wordsworth,
and this doubtless gave an impulse to his mind. <cite>The Hymn
before Sunrise</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and other strains produced in Germany, link
this period to the next. The <cite>Hexameters written during a
temporary blindness</cite>, and the <cite>Catullian Hendecasyllables</cite>
(which are freely translated from Matthisson’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Milesisches
Mährchen</cite>) Mr. Cottle seems to place in 1797,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but the
Author has marked the former as produced in 1799, and I
believe that the latter are of the same date. The <cite>Night
Scene</cite>, <cite>Myrtle leaf that ill besped</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> <cite>Maiden that with sullen
brow</cite>, are of this period, and so I believe are <cite>Lines composed
in a concert-room</cite>, and some others.</p>

<p>The poems which succeed are distinguished from those of
my Father’s Stowey life by a less buoyant spirit. Poetic
fire they have, but not the clear bright mounting flame of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_112" title="112"></a>
his earlier poetry. Their meditative vein is graver, and they
seem tinged with the sombre hues of middle age; though
some of them were written before the Author was thirty-five
years old. A characteristic poem of this period is <cite>Dejection,
an Ode</cite>: composed at Keswick, April 4, 1802. <cite>Wallenstein</cite>
had been written in London in 1800. <cite>The Three Graves</cite>
was composed in 1805 or 6;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the second part of <cite>Christabel</cite>
soon after the Author’s settling in the Lake country (in
1801);<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> <cite>Youth and Age</cite> not long before he quitted it as a
residence for ever (in 1810).<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> <cite>Recollections of Love</cite> must
have been written on his return to Keswick from Malta in
1806: <cite>The Happy Husband</cite> at that time, or earlier. The
small fragment called <cite>The Knight’s Tomb</cite> probably belongs
to the North. <cite>The Devil’s Thoughts</cite> appeared in <cite>The Morning
Post</cite> in 1800.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This production certainly has in it more
of youthful sprightliness than of middle-aged soberness;
still it is less fantastic and has more of world-wisdom in its
satire than the <cite>War Eclogue</cite> of 1796. The <cite>Complaint and
Reply</cite> first appeared in 1802. The <cite>Ode to Tranquillity</cite> was
published in <cite>The Friend</cite>, March, 1809.</p>

<p>The poems of his after years, even when sad, are calmer
in their melancholy than those produced while he was ceasing
to be young. We are less heavy-hearted when youth is
out of sight than when it is taking its leave. <cite>Duty surviving
Self-Love</cite>, <cite>The Pang more sharp than all</cite>, <cite>Love’s Apparition
and Evanishment</cite>, <cite>The Blossoming of the solitary Date tree</cite>,
and some other poems of his latter years, have this character
of resigned and subdued sadness. <cite>Work without Hope</cite> was
written at fifty-six. The <cite>Visionary Hope</cite> and <cite>The Pains of
Sleep</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which express more agitation and severer suffering,
are of earlier date. These and all in the <cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite>
were written before the end of 1817, when he had completed
his forty-fifth year. The productions of the fourth epoch,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_113" title="113"></a>
looked at as works of imagination, are tender, graceful, exquisitely
finished, but less bold and animated than those of
his earlier day. This may be said of <cite>Zapolya</cite>, <cite>Alice du Clos</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
<cite>The Garden of Boccaccio</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> <cite>The Two Founts</cite>, <cite>Lines suggested
by the last Words of Berengarius</cite>, <cite>Sancti Dominici Pallium</cite>,
and other poems written, I believe, when the poet was past
forty, the four last-named after he was fifty years old. <cite>Love,
Hope, and Patience in Education</cite> was, I think, one of his
latest poetical efforts, if not the very last.</p>

<p>The following prose compositions are included in the
poetical volumes, and the <cite>Apologetic Preface to Fire, Famine
and Slaughter</cite>, containing a comparison between Milton and
Jeremy Taylor, is placed at the end of Vol. I: <cite>An Allegoric
Vision</cite>, first published in <cite>The Courier</cite> in 1811, and <cite>New
Thoughts on Old Subjects</cite>, which first appeared in <cite>The Keepsake</cite>,
are inserted in Vol. II.</p>

<p>The whole of the Poetical Works, except a few which
have been reprinted in the <cite>Literary Remains</cite>, are contained
in the stereotyped edition in three volumes. The Poems
without the Dramas have been collected in a single volume,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
from which some of the Juvenile Poems, and two or three
of later date, are excluded, and which includes a few not
contained in the three vol. edition.</p>

<p>I now proceed to Mr. Coleridge’s compositions in Prose.
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conciones ad Populum</cite>, are two addresses to the People, delivered
at the latter end of February,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and then thrown into
a small pamphlet. “After this,” says Mr. Cottle, “he consolidated
two other of his lectures, and published them
under the title of <cite>The Plot Discovered</cite>.” A moral and
political Lecture delivered at Bristol by Mr. C. was published
in the same year. I do not know whether he printed
any of his other Bristol orations of the year ninety-five. <cite>The
Watchman</cite> was carried on in 1796. The first number appeared
March 1; the tenth and last, May 13. These were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_114" title="114"></a>
youthful immature productions. Whatever was valuable and
of a permanent nature in them was transferred into his later
productions, or included in later publications.</p>

<p><cite>The Friend</cite>, a Literary, Moral, and Political Weekly
Paper, excluding personal and party politics and the events
of the day, was written and published at Grasmere. The first
number appeared on Thursday, June 1st, 1809, the 27th
and last of that edition, March 15, 1810. <cite>The Friend</cite> next
appeared before the public in 3 vols. in 1818. This was
“rather a rifacimento,” as the Author said, “than a new
edition, the additions forming so large a proportion of the
whole work, and the arrangement being altogether new.”
(Essays V-XIII, pp. 38&ndash;128, treat of the <em>Duty of communicating
truth, and the conditions under which it may be
safely communicated</em>; Essay V is <em>on the expediency of pious
frauds, etc.</em>). The third edition of 1837 gave the Author’s
last corrections, an appendix containing the parts thrown
out in the recast, with some other <em>miscellanea</em>, and a synoptical
table of the contents by the Editor. There is now a
fourth edition.</p>

<p>The two <cite>Lay Sermons</cite> were published, the one in 1816,
the other in 1817. The first is entitled <cite>The Statesman’s
Manual</cite>, or <cite>The Bible the best Guide to Political skill and
foresight</cite>: a Lay Sermon addressed to the higher classes of
society, with an Appendix, containing comments and essays
connected with the study of the inspired writings:&mdash;the
second <cite>A Lay Sermon</cite>, addressed to the Higher and Middle
Classes, on the existing distresses and discontents. Mr.
Gillman says he “had the intention of addressing a third to
the lower classes.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite> was published in 1817, but
parts of the first volume must have been composed some
years earlier.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> in its August num<a class="pagenum" id="Page_115" title="115"></a>ber
of that year was as favourable to the book <em>as could be
expected</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<span class="subtitle">COTTLE’S DARK CHAPTER</span></h2>


<p>[Coleridge had now become a recognized public
lecturer on Poetry, and it was his last resource to keep
out of political writing, which he saw was a rather barren
business on which to waste his powers. Two courses of
lectures were given between the spring of 1812 and that of
1813. His third course was delivered at Willis’s Rooms
from 12th May to 5th June. Henry Crabb Robinson attended
the second, third and fourth of the course on 23rd,
26th, and 29th May, and has left some short accounts. His
fourth course began on 3rd November 1812 and closed on
29th January 1813. H. C. R. attended the closing lecture.
“He was received,” says H. C. R., “with three rounds of
applause on entering the lecture room, and very loudly applauded
during the lecture and at its close.” (H. C. R.
<cite>Diary</cite>.)</p>

<p>The letter to Poole of 13th February 1813 quoted in the
last chapter is only a fragment; the full text is given by Mr.
E. H. Coleridge in <cite>Letters</cite>, 609&ndash;612. It ends as follows: “You
perhaps may likewise have heard (in the Whispering Gallery
of the World) of the year-long difference between me and
Wordsworth (compared with the sufferings of which all the
former afflictions of my life were less than flea-bites), occasioned
(in great part) by the wicked folly of the arch-fool
Montagu.</p>

<p>“A reconciliation has taken place, but the <em>feeling</em>, which I
had previous to that moment, when the (three-fourth) calam<a class="pagenum" id="Page_117" title="117"></a>ity
burst, like a thunderstorm from a blue sky, on my soul,
after fifteen years of such religious, almost superstitious
idolatry and self-sacrifice. Oh no! that, I fear, can never
return. All outward actions, all inward wishes, all thoughts
and admirations will be the same&mdash;<em>are</em> the same, but&mdash;aye,
there remains an immedicable <em>But</em>.”</p>

<p>Not much is known regarding Coleridge’s whereabouts in
the summer of 1813. In September Southey came to London
and took him to see Madame De Staël (<cite>Letters of
Southey</cite>, ii, 332), who as we know was drowned by his monologue.
In the end of October Coleridge left for Bristol, and
reached the then second city of England to deliver a fifth
course of lectures on poetry which had been arranged for by
his friends there (Cottle’s <cite>Rem.</cite>, 353). The course lasted
from 28th October to 16th November (Bohn Library,
<cite>Shakespeare Lectures</cite>, p. 456). Cottle says the first lecture
was on <cite>Hamlet</cite>; but the report from the Bristol papers
(Ashe, Bohn Library, 458) contradicts this, the lecture on
<cite>Hamlet</cite> being the third. A sixth course of lectures was
arranged for, which Cottle says were well attended (<cite>Rem.</cite>,
354). Another course of four lectures on Milton, between
5th and 14th April (Ashe, Bohn Library, 457), was indifferently
attended. His eighth course of lectures, this time
on Homer, scarcely paid expenses (<cite>Cottle</cite>, 355). Although
Coleridge must have repeated himself frequently in these
lectures, they were new to Bristol. C. R. Leslie, a painter
of some note in his day, speaks favourably of them (Leslie’s
<cite>Autobiography, etc.</cite>, vol. 1, chap. 3). The following letters
belong to the visit to Bristol.</p>

my recovery, and request Mr. Roberts’s<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> prayers, for my infirm,
wicked heart; that Christ may mediate to the Father,

<div class="dateline">(5&ndash;14 April 1814.)</div>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>


<p>An erysipelatous complaint, of an alarming nature,
has rendered me barely able to attend and go through with
my lectures, the receipts of which, have almost paid the expenses
of the room, advertisements, etc.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Whether this be
to my discredit, or that of the good citizens of Bristol, it is
not for me to judge. I have been persuaded to make
another trial, by advertising three lectures, on the rise, and
progress, and conclusion of the French Revolution, with a
critique on the proposed constitution, but unless fifty names
are procured, not a lecture give I.</p>

<p>Even so the two far, far more important lectures, for
which I have long been preparing myself, and have given
more thought to, than to any other subject, viz.: those on
female education, from infancy to womanhood practically
systematized, I shall be (God permitting) ready to give the
latter end of the week after next, but upon condition that I
am assured of sixty names. Why as these are lectures that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_119" title="119"></a>
I must write down, I could sell them as a <em>recipe</em> for twice
the sum at least.</p>

<p>If I can walk out, I will be with you on Sunday. Has
Mr. Wade called on you? Mr. Le Breton, a near neighbour
of yours, in Portland Square, would, if you sent a note to
him, converse with you on any subject relative to my interest,
with congenial sympathy; but indeed I think your idea one
of those Chimeras, which kindness begets upon an unacquaintance
with mankind.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>* * * Mr. &mdash;&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> I find is raising the city against me, as
far as he and his friends can, for having stated a mere matter
of fact; viz. that Milton had represented Satan as a
sceptical Socinian; which is the case; and I could not have
explained the excellence of the sublimest single passage in
all his writings, had I not previously informed the audience,
that Milton had represented Satan, as knowing the Prophetic
and Messianic character of Christ, but was sceptical as to
any higher claims. And what other definition could Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; himself give of a sceptical Socinian? (with this difference
indeed, that Satan’s faith somewhat exceeded that of
Socinians.) Now that Satan has done so, will you consult

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>I have been engaged three days past, to dine with
the sheriff, at Merchant’s Hall to-morrow. As they will not
wield knife and fork till near six, I cannot of course attend
the meeting (for the establishment of an Infant School) but
should it be put off, and you will give me a little longer
notice, I will do my best to make my humble talents serviceable
in their proportion to a cause in which I take no common
interest, which has always my best wishes, and not
seldom my prayers. God bless you, and your affectionate
friend,</p>

</div>

<p>P.S. To you who know I prefer a roast potatoe and salt
to the most splendid public dinner, the very sight of which
always offends my infant appetite, I need not say that I am
actuated solely by my pre-engagement, and by the impropriety
of disappointing the friend whom I am to accompany,
and to whom probably I owe the unexpected compliment
of the sheriff’s invitation.</p>

<p>I have read two-thirds of Dr. Pole’s<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> pamphlet on Infant
Schools, with great interest. Thoughts on thoughts, feelings
on feelings, crowded upon my mind and heart during the
perusal, and which I would fain, God willing, give vent to!
I truly honor and love the orthodox dissenters, and appreciate
with heart-esteem their works of love. I have read,
with much pleasure, the second preface to the second
edition of your <cite>Alfred</cite>. It is well written.</p>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>On my return home yesterday, I continued unwell,
so as to be obliged to lie down for the greater part of the
evening, and my indisposition keeping me awake during the
whole night, I found it necessary to take some magnesia and
calomel, and I am at present very sick. I have little chance
of being able to stir out this morning, but if I am better I
will see you in the evening. God bless you,</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wade’s, Queen Square.</p>

<p class="p2">While Coleridge was in Bristol in 1814 Cottle for the first
time learnt of Coleridge’s addiction to opium, which is rather
surprising in one who had known him so intimately during
1795&ndash;98 and in 1807. It is remarkable, too, that in the
early years of opium taking Coleridge never hid the fact
from his friends, but freely corresponded with Tom Wedgwood
and others about the effects of opium and kindred
drugs, as if it were no secret that he was in the habit of resorting
to them. But Cottle now saw that opium had been,
in his estimation, the cause of all Coleridge’s failures to
apply his great powers to do something of the first order,
and deemed it his duty to rate Coleridge for his folly, and
wrote him the following letter:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottle to Coleridge.</span><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></h3>

<div class="dateline">Bristol, April 25, 1814.</div>

<p>Dear Coleridge,</p>

<p>I am conscious of being influenced by the purest
motives in addressing to you the following letter. Permit<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" title="122"></a>
me to remind you that I am the oldest friend you have in
Bristol, that I was such when my friendship was of more
consequence to you than it is at present, and that at that
time you were neither insensible of my kindnesses, nor
backward to acknowledge them. I bring these things to
your remembrance, to impress on your mind, that it is still
a <em>friend</em> who is writing to you; one who ever has been such,
and who is now going to give you the most decisive evidence
of his sincerity.</p>

<p>When I think of Coleridge, I wish to recall the image of
him, such as he appeared in past years; now, how has the
baneful use of opium thrown a dark cloud over you and
your prospects. I would not say anything needlessly harsh
or unkind, but I must be <em>faithful</em>. It is the irresistible voice
of conscience. Others may still flatter you, and hang upon
your words, but I have another, though a less gracious duty
to perform. I see a brother sinning a sin unto death, and
shall I not warn him? I see him perhaps on the borders of
eternity, in effect, despising his Maker’s law, and yet indifferent
to his perilous state!</p>

<p>In recalling what the expectations concerning you once
were, and the excellency with which, seven years ago, you
wrote and spoke on religious truth,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> my heart bleeds to see
how you are now fallen; and thus to notice, how many exhilarating
hopes are almost blasted by your present habits.
This is said not to wound, but to arouse you to reflection.</p>

<p>I know full well the evidences of the pernicious drug!
You cannot be unconscious of the effects, though you may
wish to forget the cause. All around you behold the wild
eye! the sallow countenance! the tottering step! the trembling
hand! the disordered frame! and yet will you not be
awakened to a sense of your danger, and I must add, your
guilt? Is it a small thing, that one of the finest of human<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" title="123"></a>
understandings should be lost! That your talents should be
buried! That most of the influences to be derived from your
present example, should be in direct opposition to right and
virtue! It is true you still talk of religion, and profess the
warmest admiration of the church and her doctrines, in
which it would not be lawful to doubt your sincerity; but
can you be unaware, that by your unguarded and inconsistent
conduct, you are furnishing arguments to the infidel;
giving occasion for the enemy to blaspheme; and (amongst
those who imperfectly know you) throwing suspicion over
your religious profession! Is not the great test in some
measure against you, “By their fruits ye shall know them?”
Are there never any calm moments, when you impartially
judge of your own actions by their consequences?</p>

<p>Not to reflect on you; not to give you a moment’s <em>needless</em>
pain, but, in the spirit of friendship, suffer me to bring to
your recollection, some of the sad effects of your undeniable
intemperance.</p>

<p>I know you have a correct love of honest independence,
without which, there can be no true nobility of mind; and
yet for opium, you will sell this treasure, and expose yourself
to the liability of arrest, by some “dirty fellow,” to whom
you choose to be indebted for “ten pounds!” You had, and
still have, an acute sense of moral right and wrong, but is
not the feeling sometimes overpowered by self-indulgence?
Permit me to remind you, that you are not more suffering in
your mind than you are in your body, while you are squandering
largely your money in the purchase of opium, which,
in the strictest equity, should receive <em>a different direction</em>.</p>

<p>I will not again refer to the mournful effects produced on
your own health from this indulgence in opium, by which
you have undermined your strong constitution; but I must
notice the injurious consequences which this passion for the
narcotic drug has on your literary efforts. What you have
already done, excellent as it is, is considered by your friends<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" title="124"></a>
and the world, as the bloom, the mere promise of the harvest.
Will you suffer the fatal draught, which is ever accompanied
by sloth, to rob you of your fame, and, what to you is a
higher motive, of your power of doing good; of giving fragrance
to your memory, amongst the worthies of future years,
when you are numbered with the dead?

(And now I would wish in the most delicate manner, to
remind you of the injurious effects which these habits of
yours produce on your family. From the estimation in which
you are held by the public, I am clear in stating, that a
small daily exertion on your part, would be sufficient to obtain
for you and them, honour, happiness, and independence.
You are still comparatively, a young man, and in such a cause,
labour is sweet. Can you withhold so small a sacrifice? Let
me sincerely advise you to return home, and live in the
circle once more, of your wife and family. There may have
been faults on one, possibly on both sides; but calumny
itself has never charged criminality. Let all be forgotten, a
small effort for the Christian. If I can become a mediator,
command me. If you could be prevailed on to adopt this
plan, I will gladly defray your expenses to Keswick, and I
am sure, with better habits, you would be hailed by your
family, I was almost going to say, as an angel from heaven.
It will also look better in the eyes of the world, who are
always prompt with their own constructions, and these constructions
are rarely the most charitable. It would also
powerfully promote your own peace of mind.</p>

<p>There is this additional view, which ought to influence
you, as it would every generous mind. Your wife and children
are domesticated with Southey. He has a family of his
own, which by his literary labour, he supports, to his great
honour; and to the extra provision required of him on your
account, he cheerfully submits; still, will you not divide
with him the honour? You have not extinguished in your
heart the Father’s feelings. Your daughter is a sweet girl.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_125" title="125"></a>
Your two boys are promising; and Hartley, concerning
whom you once so affectionately wrote, is eminently clever.
These want only a father’s assistance to give them credit and
honourable stations in life. Will you withhold so equitable
and small a boon. Your eldest son will soon be qualified
for the university, where your name would inevitably secure
him patronage, but without your aid, how is he to arrive
there; and afterward, how is he to be supported? Revolve
on these things, I entreat you, calmly, on your pillow.)<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>And now let me conjure you, alike by the voice of friendship,
and the duty you owe yourself and family: above all,
by the reverence you feel for the cause of Christianity; by
the fear of God, and the awfulness of eternity, to renounce
from this moment opium and spirits, as your bane! Frustrate
not the great end of your existence. Exert the ample
abilities which God has given you, as a faithful steward; so
will you secure your rightful pre-eminence amongst the sons
of genius; recover your cheerfulness; your health; I trust
it is not too late! become reconciled to yourself; and through
the merits of that Saviour, in whom you profess to trust,
obtain, at last, the approbation of your Maker! My dear
Coleridge, be wise before it be too late! I do hope to see
you a renovated man! and that you will still burst your inglorious
fetters, and justify the best hopes of your friends.</p>

<p>Excuse the freedom with which I write. If at the first
moment it should offend, on reflection, you will approve at
least of the motive, and, perhaps, in a better state of mind,
thank and bless me. If all the good which I have prayed
for, should not be effected by this letter, I have at least discharged
an imperious sense of duty. I wish my manner were
less exceptionable, as I do that the advice through the bless<a class="pagenum" id="Page_126" title="126"></a>ing
of the Almighty, might prove effectual. The tear which
bedims my eye, is an evidence of the sincerity with which I
subscribe myself</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad5">Your affectionate friend,</div>
  <span class="smcap">Joseph Cottle.</span>
</div>

<p>Coleridge replied to this next day:</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_158"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 158. Coleridge to Cottle.</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">April 26th, 1814.</p>

<p>You have poured oil in the raw and festering wound of an
old friend’s conscience, Cottle! but it is <em>oil of vitriol</em>! I but
barely glanced at the middle of the first page of your letter,
and have seen no more of it&mdash;not from resentment, God
forbid! but from the state of my bodily and mental sufferings,
that scarcely permitted human fortitude to let in a new
visitor of affliction.</p>

<p>The object of my present reply, is, to state the case just
as it is&mdash;first, that for ten years the anguish of my spirit has
been indescribable, the sense of my danger staring, but the
consciousness of my <span class="smcap">guilt</span> worse&mdash;far worse than all! I have
prayed, with drops of agony on my brow; trembling, not only
before the justice of my Maker, but even before the mercy
of my Redeemer. “I gave thee so many talents, what hast
thou done with them?” Secondly, overwhelmed as I am
with a sense of my direful infirmity, I have never attempted
to disguise or conceal the cause. On the contrary, not only
to friends, have I stated the whole case with tears, and the
very bitterness of shame; but in two instances, I have
warned young men, mere acquaintances, who had spoken of
having taken laudanum, of the direful consequences, by an
awful exposition of its tremendous effects on myself.</p>

<p>Thirdly, though before God I cannot lift up my eyelids,
and only do not despair of his mercy, because to despair<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" title="127"></a>
would be adding crime to crime, yet to my fellow-men, I may
say, that I was seduced into the <span class="smcap">accursed</span> habit ignorantly.
I had been almost bed-ridden for many months, with swellings
in my knees. In a medical Journal, I unhappily met
with an account of a cure performed in a similar case, or
what appeared to me so, by rubbing in of Laudanum, at the
same time taking a given dose internally. It acted like a
charm, like a miracle! I recovered the use of my limbs, of
my appetite, of my spirits, and this continued for near a
fortnight. At length the unusual stimulus subsided, the
complaint returned,&mdash;the supposed remedy was recurred to&mdash;but
I cannot go through the dreary history.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that effects were produced which acted
on me by terror and cowardice, of pain and sudden death,
not (so help me God!) by any temptation of pleasure, or
expectation, or desire of exciting pleasurable sensations. On
the very contrary, Mrs. Morgan and her sister will bear witness
so far, as to say, that the longer I abstained, the higher
my spirits were, the keener my enjoyments&mdash;till the moment,
the direful moment arrived, when my pulse began to fluctuate,
my heart to palpitate, and such falling abroad,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> as it were,
of my whole frame, such intolerable restlessness, and incipient
bewilderment, that in the last of my several attempts
to abandon the dire poison, I exclaimed in agony, which I
now repeat in seriousness and solemnity, “I am too poor to
hazard this.” Had I but a few hundred pounds, but £200&mdash;half
to send to Mrs. Coleridge, and half to place myself
in a private mad house, where I could procure nothing but
what a physician thought proper, and where a medical attendant
could be constantly with me for two or three months
(in less than that time, life or death would be determined),
then there might be hope. Now there is none!! O God!
how willingly would I place myself under Dr. Fox, in his<a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" title="128"></a>
establishment; for my case is a species of madness, only
that it is a derangement, an utter impotence of the volition,
and not of the intellectual faculties. You bid me rouse myself:
go bid a man paralytic in both arms, to rub them
briskly together, and that will cure him. “Alas!” he would
reply, “that I cannot move my arms, is my complaint and
my misery.” May God bless you, and</p>

</div>

<p>“On receiving this full and mournful disclosure,” Cottle
says, “I felt the deepest compassion for Mr. C.’s state, and
sent him the following letter. (Necessary to be given to
understand Mr. Coleridge’s reply.)”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cottle To Coleridge</span></p>

<p>Dear Coleridge,</p>

<p>I am afflicted to perceive that Satan is so busy with
you, but God is greater than Satan. Did you ever hear of
Jesus Christ? That he came into the world to save sinners?
He does not demand, as a condition, any merit of your own,
he only says, “Come and be healed!” Leave your idle
speculations: forget your vain philosophy. Come as you
are. Come and be healed. He only requires you to be
sensible of your need of him, to give him your heart, to
abandon with penitence, every evil practice, and he has
promised that whosoever thus comes, he will in no wise cast
out. To such as you Christ ought to be precious, for you
see the hopelessness of every other refuge. He will add
strength to your own ineffectual efforts.</p>

<p>For your encouragement, I express the conviction, that
such exercises as yours, are a conflict that must ultimately
prove successful. You do not cloak your sins. You confess<a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" title="129"></a>
and deplore them. I believe that you will still be as “a
brand plucked from the burning,” and that you (with all
your wanderings) will be restored, and raised up, as a chosen
instrument, to spread a Saviour’s name. Many a “chief of
sinners,” has been brought, since the days of “Saul of Tarsus,”
to sit as a little child at the Redeemer’s feet. To this
state you, I am assured, will come. Pray! Pray earnestly,
and you will be heard by your Father, which is in Heaven.
I could say many things of duty and virtue, but I wish to
direct your views at once to Christ, in whom is the alone
balm for afflicted souls.</p>

<p>P.S. If my former letter appeared unkind, pardon me!
It was not intended. Shall I breathe in your ear?&mdash;I know
one, who is a stranger to these throes and conflicts, and who
finds “Wisdom’s ways to be ways of pleasantness, and her
paths, paths of peace.”</p>

<p class="p2">To this letter Cottle received the following reply:</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_159"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 159. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p>O dear friend! I have too much to be forgiven, to feel
any difficulty in forgiving the cruellest enemy that ever
trampled on me: and you I have only to <em>thank</em>! You have
no conception of the dreadful hell of my mind, and conscience,
and body. You bid me pray. O, I do pray inwardly to be
able to pray; but indeed to pray, to pray with a faith to
which a blessing is promised, this is the reward of faith,
this is the gift of God to the elect. Oh! if to feel how
infinitely worthless I am, how poor a wretch, with just free-will
enough to be deserving of wrath, and of my own con<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" title="130"></a>tempt,
and of none to merit a moment’s peace, can make a
part of a Christian’s creed; so far I am a Christian.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_160"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 160. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash; Apl., 1814.)</p>


<p>Dear Cottle,</p>

<p>I have resolved to place myself in any situation, in
which I can remain for a month or two, as a child, wholly
in the power of others. But, alas! I have no money! Will
you invite Mr. Hood, a most dear and affectionate friend to
worthless me; and Mr. Le Breton, my old school-fellow,
and, likewise, a most affectionate friend: and Mr. Wade,
who will return in a few days: desire them to call on you,
any evening after seven o’clock, that they can make convenient,
and consult with them whether anything of this
kind can be done. Do you know Dr. Fox?</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad15">Affectionately,</div>

<p>I have to prepare my lecture. Oh! with how blank a
spirit!<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Cottle did not give his sanction to this proposal; but, on
the contrary, wrote to Southey detailing what he had discovered
about Coleridge, and requesting Southey’s opinion.
Southey wrote without delay advising other measures. Southey
had been fully cognizant of the consumption of opium and
laudanum, and says the Morgans had at one time broken<a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" title="131"></a>
him of the habit when his consumption was from two quarts
a week to a pint a day (<cite>Rem.</cite>, 373). It is difficult to credit
that any one, even habituated to the drug, could consume
this quantity; but Southey evidently believed it. An ordinary
dose of laudanum is 30 drops. 480 drops form an ounce,
and there are 20 ounces in a pint. This makes 320 doses in
a pint; and this, taken within twenty-four hours, would not
give a patient time to wake up out of his stupor, even
though administered by other hands, to take the successive
draughts. Southey recommended that Coleridge should go
and visit Poole at Stowey for a few weeks; then come on to
Keswick by way of Birmingham and Liverpool, and deliver
lectures at these places to raise funds. In answer to a second
letter by Cottle to Southey proposing to get up an annuity
among Coleridge’s friends to enable him to prosecute some
of his projects, Southey threw cold water on the scheme;
and Cottle says that Coleridge’s repugnance to visit Greta
Hall and apply his talents in the way suggested by Southey
was invincible; neither would he visit Poole, nor lecture at
Birmingham nor Liverpool. To this Mr. Hall Caine says:
“My strong conviction is that the chief bugbear for
Coleridge at Greta Hall was none other than Southey
himself.” (<cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, 126.)</p>

<p>Cottle, having been taken ill after his correspondence with
Southey, was prohibited intercourse with friends. “During
my illness,” says Cottle, “Mr. Coleridge sent my sister the
following letter and the succeeding one to myself.”</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_161"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 161. To Miss Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">13th May, 1814.</p>

<p>Dear Madam,</p>

<p>I am uneasy to know how my friend, J. Cottle, goes
on. The walk I took last Monday to enquire, in person,
proved too much for my strength, and shortly after my return,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_132" title="132"></a>
I was in such a swooning way, that I was directed to go to
bed, and orders were given that no one should interrupt me.
Indeed I cannot be sufficiently grateful for the skill with
which <em>the surgeon treats me</em>. But it must be a slow, and
occasionally, an interrupted progress, after a sad retrogress
of nearly twelve years. To God all things are possible. I
intreat your prayers, your brother has a share in mine.</p>

<p>What an astonishing privilege, that a sinner should be
permitted to cry, “Our Father!” Oh, still more stupendous
mercy, that this poor ungrateful sinner should be exhorted,
invited, nay, commanded, to pray&mdash;to pray importunately.
That which great men most detest, namely, importunacy;
to <em>this</em> the <span class="smcap">Giver</span> and the <span class="smcap">Forgiver Encourages</span> <em>his</em> sick

<h3><a id="LETTER_162"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 162. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Friday, 27th May, 1814.</p>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>Gladness be with you, for your convalescence, and
equally so, at the hope, which has sustained and tranquillized
you through your imminent peril. Far otherwise is, and hath
been, my state; yet I too am grateful; yet I cannot rejoice.
I feel, with an intensity, unfathomable by words, my utter
nothingness, impotence, and worthlessness, in and for myself.
I have learned what a sin is, against an infinite imperishable
being, such as is the soul of man.</p>

<p>I have had more than a glimpse of what is meant by
death and outer darkness, and the worm that dieth not&mdash;and
that all the <em>hell</em> of the reprobate, is no more incon<a class="pagenum" id="Page_133" title="133"></a>sistent
with the love of God, than the blindness of one who
has occasioned loathsome and guilty diseases to eat out his
eyes, is inconsistent with the light of the sun. But the consolations,
at least, the sensible sweetness of hope, I do not
possess. On the contrary, the temptation which I have constantly
to fight up against, is a fear, that if <em>annihilation</em> and
the <em>possibility</em> of <em>heaven</em>, were offered to my choice, I should
choose the former.</p>

<p>That is, perhaps, in part, a constitutional idiosyncracy, for
when a mere boy, I wrote these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Oh, what a wonder seems the fear of death,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>And in my early manhood, in lines descriptive of a gloomy
solitude, I disguised my own sensations in the following
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Here wisdom might abide, and here remorse!</div>
    <div class="line">Here too, the woe-worn man, who weak in soul,</div>

<p>My main comfort, therefore, consists in what the divines<a class="pagenum" id="Page_134" title="134"></a>
call the faith of adherence, and no spiritual effort appears to
benefit me so much as the one earnest, importunate, and
often, for hours, momently repeated prayer: “I believe,
Lord help my unbelief! Give me faith, but as a mustard
seed, and I shall remove this mountain! Faith, faith, faith!
I believe, O give me faith! O, for my Redeemer’s sake, give
me faith in my Redeemer.”</p>

<p>In all this I justify God, for I was accustomed to oppose
the preaching of the terrors of the gospel, and to represent
it as debasing virtue, by the admixture of slaving selfishness.</p>

<p>I now see that what is spiritual, can only be spiritually
apprehended. Comprehended it cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. Eden gave you a too flattering account of me. It is
true, I am restored, as much beyond my expectations
almost, as my deserts; but I am exceedingly weak. I need
for myself, solace and refocillation of animal spirits, instead
of being in a condition of offering it to others. Yet, as soon
as I may see you, I will call on you.</p>

<p>P.S. It is no small gratification to me, that I have seen

<p class="p2">“Mr. Josiah Wade,” says Cottle, “presented to me the
following mournful and touching letter, addressed to him by
Mr. Coleridge in the year 1814, which, whilst it relieved
my mind from so onerous a burden, fully corroborated all
that I had presumed, and all that I had affirmed. Mr. W.
handed this letter to me that it might be made public, in
conformity with his departed friend’s injunction.”</p>




<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_135" title="135"></a><a id="LETTER_163"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 163. To Wade</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Bristol, June 26th, 1814.</p>

<p>Dear sir,</p>

<p>For I am unworthy to call any good man friend&mdash;much
less you, whose hospitality and love I have abused;
accept, however, my intreaties for your forgiveness, and for
your prayers.</p>

<p>Conceive a poor miserable wretch, who for many years
has been attempting to beat off pain, by a constant recurrence
to the vice that reproduces it. Conceive a spirit
in hell, employed in tracing out for others the road to that
heaven, from which his crimes exclude him! In short, conceive
whatever is most wretched, helpless, and hopeless, and
you will form as tolerable a notion of my state, as it is
possible for a good man to have.</p>

<p>I used to think the text in St. James that “he who
offended in one point, offends in all,” very harsh: but I now
feel the awful, the tremendous truth of it. In the one crime
of <span class="smcap">opium</span>, what crime have I not made myself guilty of!&mdash;Ingratitude
to my Maker! and to my benefactors&mdash;injustice!
<em>and unnatural cruelty to my poor children!</em>&mdash;self-contempt
for my repeated promise&mdash;breach, nay, too often,
actual falsehood!</p>

<p>After my death, I earnestly entreat, that a full and unqualified
narration of my wretchedness, and of its guilty
cause, may be made public, that at least, some little good
may be effected by the direful example.</p>

<p>May God Almighty bless you, and have mercy on your
still affectionate, and in his heart, grateful&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime, during all this strange transaction with Cottle<a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" title="136"></a>
and Wade, Coleridge during the year 1814, was never more
brilliant in his intellectual output, whether as lecturer,
letter-writer, or political writer. His letters at this date to
Charles Mathews (<cite>Letters</cite>, 621), to Sir George Beaumont
(<cite>Col. Mem.</cite>) of 9th June; to John Murray (<cite>Letters</cite>, 624),
about a projected translation of Faust; to Daniel Stuart, of
12th September and 30th October; and to John Kenyon,
of 3rd November 1814 (<cite>Letters</cite>, 627&ndash;64), his <cite>Essays on the
Fine Arts</cite> to Felix Fairley’s <cite>Bristol Journal</cite> (August, 1814,
see <cite>Bohn Lib. Misc. Works</cite>, 4&ndash;52), and his six political
letters to the Editor of <cite>The Courier</cite> from 20th September
to 10th December 1814, show no diminution of intellectual
power, but rather sustained mental vigour. C. R. Leslie’s
account of Coleridge at this date, too, leaves us to imagine
a very different Coleridge from the one depicted in the
<cite>Reminiscences</cite> of this period. Leslie was accompanying the
Allstons from London to Bristol. Mr. Allston fell ill at Salt
Hill, and Coleridge was sent for from town. Coleridge
came to Salt Hill the same afternoon, accompanied by his
friend, Dr. Tathill. He stayed and nursed Allston. “We were
kept up late,” says Leslie, “in consequence of the critical
condition of Allston, and when he retired, Coleridge, seeing
a copy of <cite>Knickerbocker’s History of New York</cite> lying on the
table, took it up and began reading. I went to bed, and I
think he must have been up the greater part of the night,
for the next day I found he had nearly got through
<cite>Knickerbocker</cite>. He was delighted with it.” Leslie adds:
“At Salt Hill, and on some other occasions, I witnessed his
performance of the duties of friendship in a manner which
few men of his constitutional indolence could have roused
themselves to equal” (<cite>Autobiography</cite>, i, pp. 33&ndash;35).</p>

<p>Coleridge was a chameleon<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> character; and altered his
tone to suit every kind of individual with whom he came<a class="pagenum" id="Page_137" title="137"></a>
into contact. We have seen how he changed his attitude to
Godwin between his letter in <cite>The Watchman</cite> in 1796, and
his letters to the author of <cite>Political Justice</cite> in 1811. It was
the same in many cases, and Southey reproved him for it.
Hence it was that, in the presence of Cottle and Wade, of
an evangelical tone of mind, Coleridge humiliated himself
and wrote penitential letters, while at the same time towards
Sir George Beaumont, Stuart, and others, he was the Coleridge
of vast intellectual pretensions to whom no task was
impossible.</p>

<p>Whether Cottle was justified in publishing the “opium
letters” of Coleridge has always been a moot point. The
fact is Cottle had determined on “pointing a moral and
adorning a tale,” as was the custom of writers of his day,
and he enlisted the sympathy and support of Southey and
John Foster to endorse his project of making moral capital
out of the story of Coleridge’s life. The long correspondence
at the end of the <cite>Reminiscences</cite> with these two friends
regarding how much he should divulge and how much he
should keep back, is a study in the art of compromise; but
the “moralist’s duty,” as it was then called, prevailed in the
end. They had determined, as is mentioned in the last
letter of the correspondence (p. 482) by John Foster, that
“an emphatic moral lesson” should be wrung out of the life
of Coleridge; and Southey and Foster warned Cottle to be
on his guard against collaborating with Gillman&mdash;as was his
original intention&mdash;to write the <cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, lest the
“solemn warning and example should be lost” (Cottle’s
<cite>Rem.</cite>, p. 482).</p>

<p>The real cause of Coleridge’s many and harassing ailments
has now been made known. Writing to the <cite>Times</cite>
newspaper in reply to a criticism which had appeared in its
columns on Coleridge’s <cite>Letters</cite>, just published (in 1895),
and which had asserted that the perpetual cry of ill health
which echoes through the volume from end to end, meant<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" title="138"></a>
little less than “opium and indolence,” Mrs. Lucy E. Watson,
granddaughter of James Gillman, quotes a letter by the
latter narrating the circumstances attending the post mortem
examination of Coleridge’s body. The disease from which
he had suffered was enlargement of the heart, by which
the sides of that organ were so attenuated as not to be able
to sustain it when raised. An article appeared in the <cite>Lancet</cite>
on 15th June 1895 on the matter, which closes by saying:
“The record suffices to prove that this intellectual giant
must have suffered more than the world was aware of, and
it can be understood that his <em>indolence</em> as well as his opium
habit had a physical basis. It can only add to the marvel
with which his achievements are justly regarded that one
so physically disabled should have made such extensive and
profound contributions to philosophy and literature. It is
one more instance of the triumph of mind over body” (<cite>The
Gillmans of Highgate</cite>, p. 35).</p>

<p>This physical defect was the cause of all Coleridge’s
inability to execute his own ambitious schemes. As he
states in his letter to Davy of 25 March 1804, he had
Power minus Strength. His enfeeblement of will is attributable
to the physical defect of his enlarged heart; and
while he treated himself for gout and kindred ailments by
taking narcotics he, of course, only increased his own inability
to act. He was continually trying to drive what he
felt to be an inward stomach gout to the extremities. Coleridge
enjoyed, however, at rare intervals, some happy spells
of health duly recorded in his letters. He seems to have
been best while climbing hills and bathing in the dry, hard
air of the East Coast. His ascent of the Brocken, his long
walk in the Scottish Highlands in 1803, in which he accomplished
263 miles in 8 days (Letter <cite>Col. Mem.</cite> i, 7,
quoted in Dyke Campbell’s Edition of the <cite>Poems</cite>, 631), and
other hill walks seemed to inspire him with a new life. He
has given an account of the effects of mountain climbing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" title="139"></a>
on him in his letter to Tom Wedgwood of 14th January
1803, and this is one of his most surprising letters.</p>

<p>Coleridge made a great mistake, however&mdash;labouring
under the impression that his ailment was gout&mdash;of choosing
warm and slumberous climates for his health-recruiting
spheres. Malta did him no good, for he had an intellectual
affinity for the sunshine, for the land of the Lotus. In fact,
Coleridge’s addiction to opium was temperamental as well
as acquired. He contracted the habit to deaden pain, it is
true; but his nature was of an Asiatic cast. He had in his
infancy, as he tells us, been brought up on the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>, and his mind had been habituated to the Vast
(Letter 4). Joined to a dreaminess of imagination was the
love of warm climatic associations betraying the Asiatic
temperament. <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, with its slumberous melody
and vague music, embodies the Asiatic sentiment. We feel
in reading it on the borders of the Buddhistic territory. To
those endowed with such a temperament the opium habit
is easy to fall into; their dreamy soul is the seed-bed on
which it fastens. Indolence, Procrastination, vast ambitions,
unachieved accomplishments are the results: and we have
in Coleridge and his brother genius, Amiel, two examples in
the Western world of the Asiatic Genius, one terminating
his career in opium and the other in the Malady of the
Ideal. Both endeavoured to push beyond the limitations of
Humanity. “Man can destroy the harmony of his being in
two ways,” says Chateaubriand, Coleridge’s great French
contemporary and brother Romanticist, “by wishing to
love too much and by wishing to know too much” (<cite>Genius
of Christianity</cite>, 1st Part, III, chap. iii). Coleridge and
Amiel have this fault in common; it is one of the defects of
their qualities.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE MORGANS, BRISTOL, AND CALNE</span></h2>

<p class="p2">[John James Morgan, the joint friend of Coleridge
and Southey in their Pantisocratic days, was the son of a
Bristol merchant, and as early as 1795 was acquainted
with Coleridge (see Letter 16). It was to the house of
Morgan that Coleridge repaired after his return from Malta,
at the close of 1807, when he felt himself “ill, penniless, and
worse than homeless” (Meteyard’s <cite>Group of Englishmen</cite>,
p. 325); and in the <cite>Courier</cite> of 10th December 1807 appeared
a poem, entitled the <cite>Wanderer’s Farewell</cite>, addressed
to Mrs. Morgan and Charlotte Brent, her sister. Morgan was
at one time possessed of a fortune of £10,000 to £15,000
(Southey’s <cite>Life and Cor.</cite>, iv. 361); but adverse circumstances
had come against him, and he and his family had
removed to Hammersmith, London. After the quarrel with
Wordsworth, Coleridge, as we have already seen, went to
the Morgans, and remained off and on with them in the
various places of their abode for the six years between 1810
and 1816. Not only were the Morgans kind hosts to Coleridge;
Mrs. Morgan exercised a considerable command for
good over him, and put compulsory measures in force when
he was indulging in opium.</p>

<p>Although the Morgans were not exactly literary people,
they were discerners and appreciators of the genius of
Coleridge; and it was while staying with them that he produced
his greatest contributions to thinking. The Morgans
changed about a good deal. In November 1810 they were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_141" title="141"></a>
living at 7, Portland Place, Hammersmith; in April 1812
they had removed to 71, Berners Street: in April 1814 they
were at 2, Queen’s Square, Bristol; in September Coleridge
and they had taken up quarters at Ashley, Box, near Bath;
on 3rd November they were at Bath; and on 10th November
they had removed to Calne, in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>It would make an interesting study to detail in full all the
changes of Coleridge’s political creed from the time when he
was an ardent enthusiast for the French Revolution to his
gradual evolution into a conservative whose creed was</p>

<p class="center">The Sensual and the Dark rebel in vain.</p>

<p>As men advance in years they generally believe less in
the power of politics to accomplish what can be achieved
only by Religion, Poetry, Art and Culture. The contemplation
of Coleridge’s change of view from Radicalism to
temperate Conservatism, registering the natural swing of
the pendulum from Youth to Age, is a most inviting study
for the statesman. Southey and Wordsworth underwent
the same change, but their evolution is not so instructive as
that of Coleridge.</p>

<p>A Tory in the strictest sense of the word Coleridge never
was; for he always claimed right to dissent and did at
times dissent from the ministry of the hour. A striking
instance of his dissension was given while living at Calne,
when he strongly objected to the imposition of new corn
duties when wheat was selling at 63<em>s.</em> a quarter and the
quartern loaf sold at 11<em>d.</em> The working people were in a
state of starvation, and Coleridge espoused the cause of the
starvers and got up a Petition against the duties proposed.
He even became the ringleader of the local agitation. He
writes to Dr. Brabant of Devizes (6&frac12; miles away) in the
Spring of 1815: “On Wednesday we had a public meeting
in the Market Place, at Calne, to petition Parliament against
the Corn Bill. I drew it up for Mr. Wait, and afterwards<a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" title="142"></a>
mounted on the butcher’s table made a butcherly sort of
speech of an hour long to a very ragged but not butcherly
audience, for by their pale faces few of them seemed to
have had more than a very occasional acquaintance with
butcher’s meat. Loud were the huzzas, and if it depended
on the inhabitants at large, I believe they would send me up
to Parliament” (<cite>Westminster Review</cite>, 1870, p. 348).</p>

<p>Coleridge and the Morgans themselves were not in a
flourishing condition. They were in straitened circumstances,
and Coleridge wrote the following two letters to
Cottle in March 1815.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_164"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 164. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Calne, March 7, 1815.</p>

<p>Dear Cottle,</p>

<p>You will wish to know something of myself. In
health, I am not worse than when at Bristol I was best; yet
fluctuating, yet unhappy! in circumstances “poor indeed!”
I have collected my scattered, and my manuscript poems,
sufficient to make one volume. Enough I have to make
another. But till the latter is finished, I cannot without
great loss of character, publish the former on account of the
arrangement, besides the necessity of correction. For instance,
I earnestly wish to begin the volumes, with what
has never been seen by any, however few, such as a series
of Odes on the different sentences of the Lord’s Prayer, and
more than all this, to finish my greater work on <cite>Christianity,
considered as Philosophy, and as the only Philosophy</cite>.
All the materials I have in no small part reduced to form,
and written, but, oh me! what can I do, when I am so poor,
that in having to turn off every week, from these to some
mean subject for the newspapers, I distress myself, and at
last neglect the greater wholly to do little of the less. If it
were in your power to receive my manuscripts (for instance<a class="pagenum" id="Page_143" title="143"></a>
what I have ready for the press of my poems) and by
setting me forward with <em>thirty</em> or <em>forty</em> pounds, taking care
that what I send, and would make over to you, would more
than secure you from loss, I am sure you would do it. And
I would die (after my recent experience of the cruel and insolent
spirit of calumny) rather than subject myself, as a
slave, to a club of subscribers to my poverty.</p>

<p>If I were to say I am easy in my conscience, I should
add to its pains by a lie; but this I can truly say, that my
embarrassments have not been occasioned by the bad parts,
or selfish indulgences of my nature, I am at present five
and twenty pounds in arrear, my expenses being at £2 10<em>s.</em>
per week. You will say I ought to live for less, and doubtless
I might, if I were to alienate myself from all social
affections, and from all conversation with persons of the
same education. Those who severely blame me, never ask,
whether at any time in my life, I had for myself and my
family’s wants, £50 beforehand.</p>

<p>Heaven knows of the £300 received, through you, what
went to myself.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> No! bowed down under manifold infirmities,
I yet dare to appeal to God for the truth of what
I say;<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I have remained poor by always having been poor,
and incapable of pursuing any one great work, for want of a
competence beforehand.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_144" title="144"></a><a id="LETTER_165"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 165. To Cottle</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Calne, Wiltshire, March 10, 1815.</p>

<p>My dear Cottle,</p>

<p>I have been waiting with the greatest uneasiness for a
letter from you. My distresses are impatient rather than
myself: inasmuch as for the last five weeks, I know myself
to be a burden on those to whom I am under great obligations:
who would gladly do all for me; <em>but who have done
all they can!</em> Incapable of any exertion in this state of
mind, I have now written to Mr. Hood, and have at length
bowed my heart down, to beg that four or five of those,
who I had reason to believe, were interested in my welfare,
would raise the sum I mentioned, between them, should
you not find it convenient to do it. Manuscript poems,
equal to one volume of 230 to 300 pages, being sent to
them immediately. If not, I must instantly dispose of all
my poems, fragments and all, for whatever I can get from
the first rapacious bookseller, that will give anything&mdash;and
then try to get my livelihood where I am, by receiving, or
waiting on day-pupils, children, or adults, but even this I
am unable to wait for without some assistance: for I cannot
but with consummate baseness, throw the expenses of my
lodging and boarding for the last five or six weeks on those
who must injure and embarrass themselves in order to pay
them. The <cite>Friend</cite> has been long out of print, and its republication
has been called for by numbers.</p>

<p>Indeed from the manner in which it was first circulated,
it is little less than a new work. To make it a complete
and circular work, it needs but about eight or ten papers.
This I could and would make over to you at once in full
copyright, and finish it outright, with no other delay than
that of finishing a short and temperate Treatise on the Corn
Laws, and their national and moral effects; which had I
even twenty pounds only to procure myself a week’s ease of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_145" title="145"></a>
mind, I could have printed before the bill had passed the
Lords. At all events let me hear by return of post. I am
confident that whether you take the property of my Poems,
or of my Prose Essays, in pledge, you cannot eventually
lose the money.</p>

<p>As soon as I can, I shall leave Calne for Bristol, and if I
can procure any day pupils, shall immediately take cheap
lodgings near you. My plan is to have twenty pupils, ten
youths or adults, and ten boys. To give the latter three
hours daily, from eleven o’clock to two, with exception of
the usual school vacations, in the Elements of English,
Greek, and Latin, presenting them exercises for their employment
during the rest of the day, and two hours every
evening to the adults (that is from sixteen and older) on a
systematic plan of general knowledge; and I should hope
that £15 a year would not be too much to ask from each,
which excluding Sundays and two vacations, would be little
more than a shilling a day, or six shillings a week, for forty-two
weeks.</p>

<p>To this I am certain I could attend with strictest regularity,
or indeed to any thing mechanical.</p>

<p>But composition is no voluntary business. The very
necessity of doing it robs me of the power of doing it. Had
I been possessed of a tolerable competency, I should have
been a voluminous writer. But I cannot, as is feigned of
the Nightingale, sing with my breast against a thorn. God
bless you,</p>

</div>

<p>Saturday, Midnight.</p>

<p class="p2">To the first of these letters Cottle replied with a five-pound
note; but he now believed that all Coleridge’s earnings
went to fill what he calls the “Circean chalice”
(<cite>Rem.</cite>, 391). He believed that Coleridge was spending<a class="pagenum" id="Page_146" title="146"></a>
£2 10<em>s.</em> a week on opium. It is as likely that Coleridge
was now keeping the home of the Morgans going; although
they oftener kept him than he kept them. We know that
he gave them the money received for the <cite>Christabel</cite> volume.</p>

<p>From the first letter to Cottle it will be seen that Coleridge
had been collecting his poems with a view to publication,
afterwards given to the world as <cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite>. On
3rd April 1815, he writes to Lady Beaumont requesting a
copy of the Poem to Wordsworth composed on hearing the
Prelude (<cite>Coleorton Mem.</cite>, ii, 175). Wordsworth had just
published the <cite>Excursion</cite>, and on 30th May Coleridge wrote
to Wordsworth criticising that poem (Knight’s <cite>Life of
Wordsworth</cite>, ii, 255) in a long letter, which, with other
notes (<cite>Anima Poetae</cite>) of 1802, contained the germs of the
Critique of the <cite>Biographia Literaria</cite>. The <cite>Biographia</cite> was
at first merely intended as an Introduction to the <cite>Sibylline
Leaves</cite>; but in the writing it swelled so much that it had to
be published as a separate work (see Dykes Campbell’s <cite>Life</cite>,
pp. 212&ndash;14).</p>

<p>Coleridge has been charged with plagiarism from Schelling,
in composing his <cite>Biographia</cite>, by Ferrier in <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite> of 1840, and by others.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Some others complain
that Coleridge has no formal scheme of philosophy of his
own. But this is merely saying it was never written down in
its entirety, not that he did not have a philosophy. One
of the features of Coleridge is that he was never without a
Philosophy, and could not speak without betraying the fact
that he judged all things from a standpoint which was the
centre of a large planetary system of dependent and interdependent
ideas. Coleridge’s philosophy is a combination
of parts of the philosophies of Plato, Plotinus, Giordano
Bruno, Vico, Berkeley, Herder, Kant, Maas, and Schelling;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_147" title="147"></a>
he took freely from all his predecessors, as every new philosopher
is bound to do, and has done, before him. Nor is
he merely eclectic; his borrowings are fused together into a
system. His originality consists not in the ideas which he
entertains in his system, but in the reconstellation of these
ideas. To charge Coleridge with plagiarism for having
appropriated certain trains of thinking from others is on a
level with the brilliant discovery which finds that Shakespeare
pilfered some of his plots and stories from Italian novels, or
that Molière took his own where he found it (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je prend mon
bien où je le trouve</em>).</p>

<p>The valuable parts of the <cite>Biographia</cite>, however, are not
the philosophical, but the critical and biographical portions.
The Critique on Wordsworth’s poetry will always be reckoned
as the finest of our literary criticisms on Wordsworth. We
may object to Coleridge’s strictures on <cite>The Daffodils</cite> or
<cite>Alice Fell</cite>, but lovers of Wordsworth will give general acquiescence
to the contentions of Coleridge’s discriminating
criticism. Coleridge stands in the front rank of those great
exponents of Poetry and Art who, from Aristotle to Sainte-Beuve,
have guided the taste of the nations.</p>

<p>The contention of the closing paragraph that Faith is but
the continuation of Reason is founded on a saying of his
early love, Mary Evans, that “Faith is only Reason applied
to a particular subject” (<cite>Letters</cite>, 88). It was written in her
farewell letter in 1794.</p>

<p>Among the works of Coleridge undertaken at Calne was
the drama of <cite>Zapolya</cite>, in which the character of Sarolta, an
offshoot from the Christabel idea, appears.</p>

<p>These works were composed by Coleridge to tide over the
necessities of the time, but the Morgans and he were unable
to hold together, and Coleridge came once more to London
at the beginning of 1816. Morgan fell into ill health. Mrs.
Morgan latterly had to take a situation as teacher of a charity
school; Charles Lamb and Southey got up a subscription<a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" title="148"></a>
annuity of £25 for Morgan, who did not live long to enjoy
it, dying in 1820 (<cite>Southey’s Life and Correspondence</cite>, iv, 361);
and after 1823 Charlotte Brent disappears from the arena
of literary history (<cite>Letters</cite>, 722).</p>

<p>Coleridge’s letters to Dr. Brabant of Devizes, were written
between February 1815, and 5th December 1816, and are
published in the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> for 1870.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">HIGHGATE; LECTURES OF 1818</span></h2>


<p>[It was in the Spring of 1816 that Coleridge took refuge
from himself and the world and came to the Gillmans
of Highgate, and became the great lay preacher of his time.
Before this he had been staying at 42, Norfolk Street,
Strand, and consulting a physician, Dr. Joseph Adams, who
recommended him to Mr. Gillman. The letter of Dr.
Adams to Mr. Gillman is as follows:</p>


<p class="dateline">Hatton Garden, April 9, 1816.</p>

<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p>A very learned, but in one respect an unfortunate
gentleman, has applied to me on a singular occasion. He
has for several years been in the habit of taking large quantities
of opium. For some time past he has been in vain
endeavouring to break himself of it. It is apprehended his
friends are not firm enough, from a dread, lest he should
suffer by suddenly leaving it off, though he is conscious of the
contrary; and has proposed to me to submit himself to any
regimen, however severe. With this view he wishes to fix
himself in the house of some medical gentleman, who will
have courage to refuse him any laudanum, and under whose
assistance, should he be the worse for it, he may be relieved.
As he is desirous of retirement, and a garden, I could think
of no one so readily as yourself. Be so good as to inform me
whether such a proposal is absolutely inconsistent with your
family arrangements. I should not have proposed it, but<a class="pagenum" id="Page_150" title="150"></a>
on account of the great importance of the character, as a
literary man. His communicative temper will make his
society very interesting, as well as useful. Have the goodness
to favour me with an immediate answer, and believe
me, dear sir,</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad5">Your faithful humble servant,</div>
  <span class="smcap">Joseph Adams.</span>
</div>

<p>Before calling on Dr. Gillman, Coleridge wrote the following
letter:</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_166"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 166. To James Gillman</span></h3>

<div class="dateline">
<div>42, Norfolk Street, Strand, Saturday Noon.</div>
<div class="pad5">(April 13, 1816.)</div>
</div>

<p>My Dear Sir.</p>

<p>The first half hour I was with you convinced me
that I should owe my reception into your family exclusively
to motives not less flattering to me than honourable to
yourself. I trust we shall ever in matters of intellect be
reciprocally serviceable to each other. Men of sense
generally come to the same conclusions; but they are
likely to contribute to each other’s enlargement of view, in
proportion to the distance or even opposition of the points
from which they set out. Travel and the strange variety of
situations and employments on which chance has thrown
me, in the course of my life, might have made me a mere
man of <em>observation</em>, if pain and sorrow and self-miscomplacence
had not forced my mind in on itself, and so
formed habits of <em>meditation</em>. It is now as much my nature
to evolve the fact from the law, as that of a practical man to
deduce the law from the fact.</p>

<p>With respect to pecuniary remuneration, allow me to say,
I must not at least be suffered to make any addition to your
family expenses&mdash;though I cannot offer anything that would
be in any way adequate to my sense of the service; for<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" title="151"></a>
that indeed there could not be a compensation, as it must
be returned in kind, by esteem and grateful affection.</p>

<p>And now of myself. My ever wakeful reason, and the
keenness of my moral feelings, will secure you from all
unpleasant circumstances connected with me save only one,
viz. the evasion of a specific madness. You will never <em>hear</em>
anything but truth from me:&mdash;prior habits render it out of
my power to tell an untruth, but unless carefully observed,
I dare not promise that I should not, with regard to this
detested poison, be capable of acting one. No sixty hours
have yet passed without my having taken laudanum, though
for the last week comparatively trifling doses. I have full
belief that your anxiety need not be extended beyond the
first week, and for the first week, I shall not, I must not be
permitted to leave your house, unless with you. Delicately
or indelicately this must be done, and both the servants
and the assistant must receive absolute commands from
you. The stimulus of conversation suspends the terror that
haunts my mind; but when I am alone, the horrors I have
suffered from laudanum, the degradation, the blighted
utility, almost overwhelm me. If (as I feel for the <em>first
time</em> a soothing confidence it will prove) I should leave you
restored to my moral and bodily health, it is not myself
only that will love and honour you; every friend I have
(and thank God! in spite of this wretched vice<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> I have
many and warm ones, who were friends of my youth, and
have never deserted me,) will thank you with reverence. I
have taken no notice of your kind apologies. If I could
not be comfortable in your house, and with your family, I
should deserve to be miserable. If you could make it convenient,
I should wish to be with you by Monday evening,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" title="152"></a>
as it would prevent the necessity of taking fresh lodgings
in town.</p>

<p>With respectful compliments to Mrs. Gillman and her
sister, I remain, dear sir,</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad5">Your much obliged,</div>
  <span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
</div>

<p>The Gillmans felt spellbound by Coleridge’s talk, and
consented to receive him into their household, where he
remained for the last eighteen years of his life.</p>

<p>It was at Highgate that Coleridge sat looking down upon
the “illimitable limitary ocean of London,” as Carlyle finely
puts it. He had still his ambitions to do something for the
Permanent; but the world of England was not yet ripe for
Transcendentalism, and the fine distinctions between the
Reason and the Understanding, Imagination and Fancy, the
Person and the Thing, and all the other subtle analysings of
the Human Intellect; but he still had his lore on Shakespeare
to fall back on, and he could re-churn it into a new
series of Lectures. His ninth course he delivered in 1818,
27th January to 13th March. The course was delivered at
“Flower de Luce” Court (Fleur-de-Lis Court). The notes
of these lectures occupy about a half of the Bohn Library
volume of the <cite>Lectures on Shakespeare</cite>. They are often, like
the rest of Coleridge’s prose writing, a series of brilliant
digressions from the main point, but like De Quincey’s
similar wanderings, they often come wonderfully round to
the subject in hand. H. Crabb Robinson attended only
four of the course, and he does not give a very favourable
account of them. Gillman says: “He lectured from notes,
yet it was obvious that his audience was more delighted
when, putting his notes aside, he spoke extempore. He
was brilliant, fluid, and rapid; his words seemed to flow from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_153" title="153"></a>
a person repeating with grace and energy some delightful
poem. If, however, he sometimes paused, it was not for the
want of words, but that he was seeking the most appropriate,
or their most logical arrangement.” The following letters,
given by Gillman in his <cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, are supposed to
belong to this period.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_167"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 167. To &mdash;&mdash;</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash; 1816?)</p>

<p>In a copy of verses, entitled <cite>A Hymn before Sunrise in
the Vale of Chamouni</cite>, I describe myself under the influence
of strong devotional feelings, gazing on the mountain, till as
if it had been a shape emanating from and sensibly representing
her own essence, my soul had become diffused
through the mighty vision: and there,</p>

<p class="center">As in her natural form, swell’d vast to Heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Wordsworth, I remember, censured the passage as
strained and unnatural, and condemned the hymn in toto,
(which, nevertheless, I ventured to publish in my <cite>Sibylline
Leaves</cite>,) as a specimen of the mock sublime. It may be so
for others, but it is impossible that I should myself find it
unnatural, being conscious that it was the image and utterance
of thoughts and emotions in which there was no
mockery. Yet, on the other hand, I could readily believe
that the mood and habit of mind out of which the hymn
rose, that differs from Milton’s and Thomson’s and from
the psalms, the source of all three, in the author’s addressing
himself to <em>individual</em> objects actually present to his senses,
while his great predecessors apostrophize <em>classes</em> of things
presented by the memory, and generalized by the understanding;&mdash;I
can readily believe, I say, that in this there
may be too much of what our learned <em>med’ciners</em> call the
<em>idiosyncratic</em> for true poetry.&mdash;For, from my very childhood,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" title="154"></a>
I have been accustomed to <em>abstract</em>, and as it were, unrealize
whatever of more than common interest my eyes
dwelt on, and then by a sort of transfusion and transmission
of my consciousness to identify myself with the object; and
I have often thought within the last five or six years, that if
ever I should feel once again the genial warmth and stir of
the poetic impulse, and refer to my own experiences, I
should venture on a yet stranger and wilder allegory than of
yore&mdash;that I would allegorize myself as a rock, with its
summit just raised above the surface of some bay or strait
in the Arctic Sea, “while yet the stern and solitary night
brooked no alternate sway”&mdash;all around me fixed and firm,
methought, as my own substance, and near me lofty masses,
that might have seemed to “hold the moon and stars in fee,”
and often in such wild play with meteoric lights, or with the
quiet shine from above, which they made rebound in
sparkles, or dispand in off-shoot, and splinters, and iridescent
needle shafts of keenest glitter, that it was a pride and
a place of healing to lie, as in an apostle’s shadow, within
the eclipse and deep substance-seeming gloom of “these
dread ambassadors from earth to heaven, great hierarchs!”
And though obscured, yet to think myself obscured by consubstantial
forms, based in the same foundation as my own.
I grieved not to serve them&mdash;yea, lovingly and with gladsomeness
I abased myself in their presence: for they are
my brothers, I said, and the mastery is theirs by right of
older birth, and by right of the mightier strivings of the
hidden fire that uplifted them above me.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_168"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 168. To &mdash;&mdash;</span><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></h3>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash;1816?)</p>

<p>My dear sir,</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for your kind remembrance of me,
and for the proof of it in the present of your tribute of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_155" title="155"></a>
friendship, I have read it with uninterrupted interest, and
with satisfaction scarcely less continuous. In adding the
three last words, I am taking the word satisfaction in its
strictest sense: for had I written pleasure, there would have
been no ground for the limitation. Indeed as it was, it is a
being scrupulous over much. For at the two only passages
at which I made a moment’s <em>halt</em> (viz. § p. 3, and p. 53,
last line but five,) “she had seldom”&mdash;&mdash;“oppressive awe,”
my not <em>objection</em> but <em>stoppage</em> at the latter amounted only to a
doubt, a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">quære</em>, whether the trait of character here given
should not have been followed by some little comment, as
for instance, that such a state of feeling, though not
desirable in a regenerate person, in whom belief had wrought
love, and love obedience, must yet be ranked amongst
those constitutional differences that may exist between the
best and wisest Christians, without any corresponding difference
in their spiritual progress. One saint fixes his eyes on
the <em>palm</em>, another saint thinks of the previous <em>conflict</em>, and
closes them in prayer. Both are waters of the same fountain&mdash;<em>this</em>
the basin, <em>that</em> the salient column, both equally
dear to God, and both may be used as examples for men,
the one to invite the thoughtless sceptic, the other to alarm
the reckless believer. You will see, therefore, that I do not
object to the sentence itself; but as a matter of <em>feeling</em>, it
met me too singly and suddenly. I had not anticipated
such a trait, and the surprise counterfeited the sensation of
perplexity for a moment or two. On as little objection to
anything you have said, did the <em>desiderium</em> the sense of not
being quite satisfied, proceed in regard to the § p. 3. In
the particular instance in the application of the sentiment, I
found nothing to question or qualify. It was the rule or
principle which a certain class of your readers might be inclined
to deduce from it, it was the possible generalization
of the particular instance that made me pause. I am
jealous of the disposition to turn Christianity or Religion<a class="pagenum" id="Page_156" title="156"></a>
into a particular <em>business</em> or line. “Well, Miss, how does
your pencil go on, I was delighted with your last landscape.”
“Oh, sir, I have quite given <em>up</em> that, I have got into the
religious line.” Now, my dear sir, the rule which I have
deduced from the writings of St. Paul and St. John, and
(permit me also to add) of Luther, would be this. Form
and endeavour to strengthen into an habitual and instinct-like
feeling, the sense of the utter incompatibility of Christianity
with every thing wrong or unseemly, with whatever
betrays or fosters the mind of flesh, the predominance of
the <em>animal</em> within us, by having habitually present to the
mind, the full and lively conviction of its perfect compatibility
with whatever is innocent of its harmony, with whatever
contra-distinguishes the <span class="smcap">Human</span> from the animal; of
its sympathy and coalescence with the cultivation of the
faculties, affections, and fruitions, which God hath made
<em>peculiar</em> to <em>man</em>, either wholly or in their ordained <em>combination</em>
with what is peculiar to humanity, the blurred, but not
obliterated signatures of our original title deed, (and God
said, man will we make in our own image.) What?&mdash;shall
Christianity exclude or alienate us from those powers,
acquisitions, and attainments, which Christianity is so preeminently
calculated to elevate and enliven and sanctify?</p>

<p>Far, very far, am I from suspecting in you, my dear sir,
any participation in these prejudices of a shrivelled proselyting
and censorious religionist. But a numerous and
stirring faction there is, in the so-called Religious Public,
whose actual and actuating principles, with whatever vehemence
they may disclaim it in words, is, that redemption is
a something not yet effected&mdash;that there is neither sense
nor force in our baptism&mdash;and that instead of the Apostolic
command, <em>Rejoice, and again I say unto you, rejoice</em>; baptized
Christians are to put on sackcloth and ashes, and
try, by torturing themselves and others, to procure a rescue
from the devil. Again, let me thank you for your remem<a class="pagenum" id="Page_157" title="157"></a>brance
of me, and believe me from the hour we first met at
Bristol, with esteem and regard,</p>

<p>In 1816 an attempt was made to revive <cite>Remorse</cite> at Drury
Lane, and Coleridge had some intercourse with Byron regarding
it and another tragedy he was proposing to write
for the theatre (<cite>Westminster Review</cite>, 94 (1874), p. 2). He
wrote the following fragment on Byron probably about this
time:</p>

<span class="subtitle">THOMAS ALLSOP</span></h2>

<p>[Coleridge’s lectures and his conversations at the
Gillmans brought him many new friends. Among
others was Thomas Allsop, a young London merchant,
whose acquaintance dates from January, 1818; and which,
by December, had ripened into close friendship. Allsop
acted as the Boswell of the later period of Coleridge’s life,
and by his devotion made up for the absence of Wordsworth
and Poole. He afterwards published the letters he received
from Coleridge, and some of Coleridge’s axiomatic sayings
and conversations. Allsop was also a friend of Charles
Lamb, and often visited Highgate in company with Elia,
who made Allsop one of his testamentary trustees (<cite>Ainger</cite>,
ii, 82, 85). The following letters to Allsop indicate the
birth of the intimacy between Coleridge and him.</p>



<h3><a id="LETTER_170"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 170. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Jan. 28th, 1818.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your friendly letter was first delivered to me at the
lecture-room door on yesterday evening, ten minutes before
the lecture, and my spirits were so sadly depressed by the
circumstance of my hoarseness, that I was literally incapable
of reading it. I now express my acknowledgments, and with
them the regret that I had not received the letter in time to
have availed myself of it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" title="159"></a>When I was young I used to laugh at flattery, as, on
account of its absurdity, I now abhor it, from my repeated
observations of its mischievous effects. Amongst these, not
the least is, that it renders honourable natures more slow
and reluctant in expressing their real feelings in praise of
the deserving, than, for the interests of truth and virtue,
might be desired. For the weakness of our moral and intellectual
being, of which the comparatively strongest are
often the most, and the most painfully conscious, needs the
confirmation derived from the coincidence and sympathy of
the friend, as much as the voice of honour within us
denounces the pretences of the flatterer. Be assured, then,
that I write as I think, when I tell you that, from the style
and thoughts of your letter, I should have drawn a very
different conclusion from that which you appear to have
done, concerning both your talents and the cultivation which
they have received. Both the matter and manner are manly,
simple, and correct.</p>

<p>Had I the time in my power, compatibly with the performance
of duties of immediate urgency, I would endeavour to
give you, by letter, the most satisfactory answer to your
questions that my reflections and the experience of my own
fortunes could supply. But, at all events, I will not omit to
avail myself of your judicious suggestion in my last lecture,
in which it will form a consistent part of the subject and
purpose of the discourse. Meantime, believe me, with great
respect,</p>

<p>Those who have hitherto chosen to take notice of
me, as known to them only by my public character, have for

<p>“Logical subtleties and metaphysical trains of argument
form neither part nor object of the present Plan, which supposes
no other qualification in the auditors of either sex than
a due interest in questions of deepest concern to all, and
which every rational creature, who has arrived at the age of
reflection, must be presumed, at some period or other, to
have put to his own thoughts:&mdash;What, and <em>for</em> what am I
made? What <em>can</em> I, and what <em>ought</em> I to, make of myself?
and in what relations do I stand to the world and to my
fellow men? Flattering myself with a continuance of the
kind and respectful attention, with which my former courses
have been honoured, I have so little apprehension of not
being intelligible throughout, that were it in my power to
select my auditors, the majority would, perhaps, consist of
persons whose acquaintance with the History of Philosophy
would commence with their attendance on the Course of
Lectures here announced. When, indeed, I contemplate
the many and close connexions of the subject with the most
interesting periods of History; the instances and illustrations
which it demands and will receive from Biography, from
individuals of the most elevated genius, or of the most
singular character: I cannot hesitate to apply to it as a
whole what has been already said of an important part (I
allude to Ecclesiastical History)&mdash;that for every reflecting
mind it has a livelier as well as deeper interest, than that of
fable or romance.</p>

<p>Nor can these Lectures be justly deemed superfluous even as a literary
work. We have, indeed, a History of Philosophy, or rather a folio<a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" title="162"></a>
volume so called, by <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, and <span class="smcap">Enfield’s</span> Abridgment of the
massive and voluminous <span class="smcap">Brucker</span>. But what are they? Little more,
in fact, than collections of sentences and extracts, formed into separate
groups under the several names, and taken (at first or second hand) from
the several writings of individual philosophers, with no <em>Principle</em> of
arrangement, with no <em>method</em>, and therefore without unity and without
progress or completion. Hard to be understood as detached passages,
and impossible to be remembered as a whole, they leave at last on the
mind of the most sedulous student but a dizzy recollection of jarring
opinions and wild fancies. Whatever value these works may have as
books of reference, so far from <em>superseding</em>, they might seem rather to
<em>require</em>, a work like the present, in which the accidental influences of
particular periods and individual genius are by no means overlooked,
but which yet does in the main consider Philosophy historically, as an
essential part of the history of man, and as if it were the striving of a
single mind, under very different circumstances indeed, and at different
periods of its own growth and development; but so that each change
and every new direction should have its cause and its explanation in the
errors, insufficiency or prematurity of the preceding, while all by reference
to a common object is reduced to harmony of impression and total
result. Now this object, which is one and the same in all the forms of
Philosophy, and which alone constitutes a work <em>Philosophic</em>, is&mdash;the
origin and primary laws (or efficient causes) either of the <span class="smcap">world</span>, man
included (which is <em>Natural</em> Philosophy)&mdash;or of Human Nature exclusively,
and as far only as it is <em>human</em> (which is <em>Moral</em> Philosophy).
If to these we subjoin, as a third problem, the question concerning the
sufficiency of the human reason to the solution of both or either of the
two former, we shall have a full conception of the sense in which the
term Philosophy is used in this Prospectus and the Lectures corresponding
to it.</p>

<p>The main Divisions will be&mdash;1. From Thales and Pythagoras to the
appearance of the Sophists. 2. And of Socrates. The character and
effect of Socrates’ life and doctrines, illustrated in the instances of
Xenophon, as his most faithful representative, and of Antisthenes, or the

or the Cyrenaic sect, as the other and opposite extreme. 3. Plato and
Platonism. 4. Aristotle and the Peripatetic school. 5. Zeno and
Stoicism, Epicurus and Epicureans, with the effects of these in the
Roman republic and empire. 6. The rise of the Eclectic or Alexandrine
Philosophy, the attempt to set up a pseudo-Platonic Polytheism against
Christianity, the degradation of Philosophy itself into mysticism and
magic, and its final disappearance, as Philosophy, under Justinian.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_163" title="163"></a>

<p class="p2">The last letter refers to lectures delivered from 19th
December 1818 to April 1819, his tenth course. Another
course on Shakespeare was also being given at the same
time, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, Strand (Dykes
Campbell’s <cite>Life</cite>, 238), commencing 17th December 1818.
No record has been published of these two series of lectures

<h3><a id="LETTER_173"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 173. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Dec. 2nd, 1818.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I cannot express how kind I felt your letter. Would
to Heaven I had had many with feelings like yours, “accustomed
to express themselves warmly and (as far as the word
is applicable to you, even) enthusiastically.” But, alas!
during the prime manhood of my intellect I had nothing
but cold water thrown on my efforts. I speak not now of
my systematic and most unprovoked maligners. On <em>them</em> I
have retorted only by pity and by prayer. These may have,
and doubtless <em>have</em>, joined with the frivolity of “the reading
public” in checking and almost in preventing the sale of
my works; and so far have done injury to my <em>purse</em>. <em>Me</em>
they have not injured. But I have loved with enthusiastic
self-oblivion those who have been so well pleased that I
should, year after year, flow with a hundred nameless rills
into <em>their</em> main stream, that they could find nothing but cold
praise and effective discouragement of every attempt of mine<a class="pagenum" id="Page_164" title="164"></a>
to roll onward in a distinct current of my own; who <em>admitted</em>
that the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, the <cite>Christabel</cite>, the <cite>Remorse</cite>, and
some pages of the <cite>Friend</cite> were not without merit, but were
abundantly anxious to acquit their judgments of any blindness
to the very numerous defects. Yet they <em>knew</em> that to
<em>praise</em>, as mere praise, I was characteristically, almost constitutionally,
indifferent. In sympathy alone I found at once
nourishment and stimulus; and for sympathy <em>alone</em> did my
heart crave. They knew, too, how long and faithfully I had
acted on the maxim, never to admit the <em>faults</em> of a work of
genius to those who denied or were incapable of feeling and
understanding the <em>beauties</em>; not from wilful partiality, but as
well knowing that in <em>saying</em> truth, I should, to such critics,
convey falsehood. If, in one instance, in my literary life, I
have appeared to deviate from this rule, first, it was not till
the fame of the writer<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> (which I had been for fourteen years
successively toiling like a second Ali to build up) had been
established; and, secondly and chiefly, with the purpose
and, I may safely add, with the <em>effect</em> of rescuing the necessary
task from Malignant Defamers, and in order to set forth
the excellences and the trifling proportion which the defects
bore to the excellences. But this, my dear sir, is a mistake
to which affectionate natures are too liable, though I do not
remember to have ever seen it noticed,&mdash;the mistaking those
who are desirous and well pleased to be loved <em>by</em> you, for
those who love you. Add, as a more general cause, the fact
that I neither am nor ever have been of any party. What
wonder, then, if I am left to decide which has been my
worse enemy, the broad, pre-determined abuse of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, &amp;c., or the cold and brief compliments, with
the warm <em>regrets</em>, of the <cite>Quarterly</cite>? After all, however, I
have now but one sorrow relative to the ill success of my
literary toils (and toils they have been, <em>though not undelight<a class="pagenum" id="Page_165" title="165"></a>ful
toils</em>), and this arises wholly from the almost insurmountable
difficulties which the anxieties of to-day oppose to my
completion of the great work, the form and materials of
which it has been the employment of the best and most
genial hours of the last twenty years to mature and collect.</p>

<p>If I could but have a tolerably numerous audience to my
first, or first and second Lectures on the <span class="smcap">History of Philosophy</span>,
I should entertain a strong hope of success, because
I know that these lectures will be found by far the most
interesting and <em>entertaining</em> of any that I have yet delivered,
independent of the more permanent interests of rememberable
instruction. Few and unimportant would the errors of
men be, if they did but know, first, <em>what they themselves
meant</em>; and, secondly, what the <em>words</em> mean by which they
attempt to convey their meaning; and I can conceive no
subject so well fitted to exemplify the mode and the importance
of these two points as the History of Philosophy, treated
as in the scheme of these lectures. Trusting that I shall
shortly have the pleasure of seeing you here,</p>

<p class="p2">At the close of 1818, Coleridge published his <cite>Essay on
Method</cite>, an introduction to the <cite>Encyclopedia Metropolitana</cite>,
which exhibits his grasping ambitious intellect.</p>

<p>The two following letters to Mr. Britton were written
regarding his lectures. Neither Thomas Ashe nor Dykes
Campbell has been able to find any evidence that Coleridge
delivered lectures on Shakespeare seventeen years before
1819. He must have been labouring under a delusion on
this matter and mistaking the date of his lectures delivered
in 1808.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_174"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 174. To Mr. Britton</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Highgate, 28th Feb., 1819.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>First permit me to remove a very natural, indeed almost
inevitable, mistake, relative to my lectures; namely,
that I <em>have</em> them, or that the lectures of one place or season
are in any way repeated in another. So far from it, that on
any point that I had ever studied (and on no other should
I dare discourse&mdash;I mean, that I would not lecture on any
subject for which I had to <em>acquire</em> the main knowledge, even
though a month’s or three month’s previous time were allowed
me; on no subject that had not employed my thoughts for
a large portion of my life since earliest manhood, free of all
outward and particular purpose)&mdash;on any point within my
habit of thought, I should greatly prefer a subject I had
never lectured on, to one which I had repeatedly given; and
those who have attended me for any two seasons successively
will bear witness, that the lecture given at the London
Philosophical Society, on the <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, for instance,
was as different from that given at the Crown and Anchor,
as if they had been by two individuals who, without any
communication with each other, had only mastered the
same principles of philosophical criticism. This was most
strikingly evidenced in the coincidence between my lectures
and those of Schlegel; such, and so close, that it was fortunate
for my moral reputation that I had not only from five
to seven hundred ear witnesses that the passages had been
given by me at the Royal Institution two years before
Schlegel commenced his lectures at Vienna, but that notes
had been taken of these by several men and ladies of high
rank. The fact is this; during a course of lectures, I faithfully
employ all the intervening days in collecting and digesting
the materials, whether I have or have not lectured on the same<a class="pagenum" id="Page_167" title="167"></a>
subject before, making no difference. The day of the lecture,
till the hour of commencement, I devote to the consideration,
what of the mass before me is best fitted to answer the
purposes of a lecture, that is, to keep the audience awake
and interested during the delivery, and to leave a sting behind,
that is, a disposition to study the subject anew, under
the light of a new principle. Several times, however, partly
from apprehension respecting my health and animal spirits,
partly from the wish to possess copies that might afterwards
be marketable among the publishers, I have previously
written the lecture; but before I had proceeded twenty
minutes, I have been obliged to push the MS. away, and
give the subject a new turn. Nay, this was so notorious,
that many of my auditors used to threaten me, when they
saw any number of written papers on my desk, to steal them
away; declaring they never felt so secure of a good lecture
as when they perceived that I had not a single scrap of
writing before me. I take far, far more pains than would go
to the set composition of a lecture, both by varied reading
and by meditation; but for the words, illustrations, &amp;c., I
know almost as little as any of the audience (that is, those
of anything like the same education with myself) what they
will be five minutes before the lecture begins. Such is my
way, for such is my nature; and in attempting any other, I
should only torment myself in order to disappoint my
auditors&mdash;torment myself during the delivery, I mean; for
in all other respects it would be a much shorter and easier
task to deliver them from writing. I am anxious to preclude
any semblance of affectation; and have therefore troubled
you with this lengthy preface before I have the hardihood
to assure you, that you might as well ask me what my dreams
were in the year 1814, as what my course of lectures was at
the Surrey Institution. <cite>Fuimus Troes.</cite></p>



<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" title="168"></a><a id="LETTER_175"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 175. To Mr. Britton</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(Feb.-Mch., 1819)</p>

<p>My next Friday’s lecture will, if I do not grossly flatter-blind
myself, be interesting, and the points of view not only
original, but new to the audience. I make this distinction,
because sixteen or rather seventeen years ago, I delivered
eighteen lectures on Shakespeare, at the Royal Institution;
three-fourths of which appeared at that time startling paradoxes,
although they have since been adopted even by men,
who then made use of them as proofs of my flighty and
paradoxical turn of mind; all tending to prove that Shakespeare’s
judgment was, if possible, still more wonderful than
his genius; or rather, that the contra-distinction itself between
judgment and genius rested on an utterly false theory.
This, and its proofs and grounds have been&mdash;I should not
have said adopted, but produced as their own legitimate
children by some, and by others the merit of them attributed
to a foreign writer, whose lectures were not given orally till
two years after mine, rather than to their countryman; though
I dare appeal to the most adequate judges, as Sir George
Beaumont, the Bishop of Durham, Mr. Sotheby, and afterwards
to Mr. Rogers and Lord Byron, whether there is one
single principle in Schlegel’s work (which is not an admitted
drawback from its merits), that was not established and
applied in detail by me. Plutarch tells us, that egotism is a
venial fault in the unfortunate, and justifiable in the calumniated, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Dykes Campbell thinks these letters to Mr. Britton
refer to a course projected to be given at the Russell Institution;
but there is no evidence that another Shakespeare
course was delivered after that of 1818&ndash;19 (Dykes Camp<a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" title="169"></a>bell’s
<cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, p. 240). Coleridge’s indebtedness to
Kant, Lessing, Herder, Schiller, Jean Paul Richter, and
Augustus Schlegel is traced by Brandl (<cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>,
pp. 296&ndash;322). Schlegel’s Lectures were delivered in 1808,
the same year as Coleridge’s first course. Coleridge did not
peruse Schlegel’s <cite>Lectures</cite> till 1811; but as no full record
of his Lectures of 1808 exist, the original indebtedness of
Coleridge to Schlegel cannot be determined.</p>

<p>During his stay at Highgate, Coleridge occasionally went
to Ramsgate to enjoy the seaside. The next letter was
written on his return from one of his visits to Ramsgate.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_176"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 176. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Highgate, Sept. 30th, 1819.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Returned from Ramsgate, I hasten to assure you
that, next to seeing you, I have pleasure in hearing from
you: and wish the former in preference, not merely from the
greater mutual enjoyment, but likewise because one can
convey more, and with greater assurance of being understood,
in an hour, than one could write in a day. On the
other hand, letters are more permanent, and an epistolary
correspondence more endearing, like all marks of remembrance
in absence.</p>

<p>My sentiments concerning the expediency, and both
moral and intellectual advantages, of a trade or profession,
for such as fix their ultimate end on objects nobler than
trades or professions can bestow on the most favoured of
their followers, may be learnt from the eleventh chapter of
my <cite>Literary Life</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> which, though addressed to a small and
particular class, yet permits a more general application. To
you, my dear young friend, I should say, temptations and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" title="170"></a>
preventives&mdash;the poisons and the antidotes&mdash;are pretty evenly
dispersed through all the different accredited paths of life.
Nay, those temptations which are foreknown and foreseen
as most appertinent to our particular calling, are commonly
least dangerous, or even cease to be temptations to a mind
forearmed by principles and aspirations like yours. The
false step is more likely to take place in the recoil than the
advance; in the neglect rather than in the too eager pursuit
of the means; in under, rather than over, valuing the advantages
of wealth and worldly respectability. The true
plan on which you should regulate your conduct and feelings,
(that at least, which to me appears such) is the following.
Propose to yourself from the present hour such views of
action and enjoyment, as will make the leisure attached to
independence, and honourably earned by previous industry,
the fair object of a wise man’s efforts and a good man’s
desires. Meantime, let the chosen <em>employments</em> of the years
in <em>hope</em> be the <em>relaxations</em> of the time present, of the years
devoted to present duties, and, among these, to the means
of realising that hope; thus you will answer two great ends
at once. Your inward trains of thought, your faculties, and
your feelings, will be preserved in a fitness and, as it were,
contempered to a life of ease, and capable of enjoying
leisure, because both able and disposed to <em>employ</em> it. Secondly,
while you thus render future affluence more and more desirable,
you will at the same time prevent all undue impatience,
and disarm the temptation of poisoning the allotted interval
by <em>anxieties</em>, and anxious schemes and efforts to get rich <em>in
haste</em>. There is yet one other inducement to look on your
existing appointment with complacency. Every improvement
in knowledge, and the moral power of wielding and
directing it, will <em>tell for more</em>,&mdash;have a wider and more benignant
influence,&mdash;than the same accomplishment would in
a man who belonged to one of the learned professions.
Both your information and your example will fall where they<a class="pagenum" id="Page_171" title="171"></a>
are most wanted, like the noiseless dews in Malta, where
rain comes seldom and no regular streams are to be met
with. As to your present studies, for such portions of your
time as you can prudently appropriate to reading, without
wrong to the claims of health and <em>social</em> relaxation, there
is one department of knowledge, which, like an ample
palace, contains within itself mansions for every other knowledge;
which deepens and extends the interest of every
other, gives it new charms and additional purpose; the
study of which, rightly and <em>liberally</em> pursued, is beyond any
other <em>entertaining</em>, beyond all others tends at once to tranquillize
and enliven, to keep the mind elevated and steadfast,
the heart humbler and tender: it is <em>biblical theology</em>&mdash;the
philosophy of religion, the religion of philosophy. I would
that I could refer you to any <em>book</em> in which such a plan of
reading had been sketched out, in detail or even but generally.</p>

<p>Alas! I know of none. But most gladly will I make the
attempt to supply this desideratum by conversation, and
then by letter. But of this when I have next the pleasure
of seeing you at Highgate.</p>

<p>You have perhaps heard that my publisher is a bankrupt.</p>

<p>All the profits from the sale of my writings, which I should
have had, and which, in spite of the accumulated disadvantages
under which the works were published, would have
been considerable, I have lost; and not only so, but have
been obliged, at a sum larger than all the profits made by
my lectures, to purchase myself my own books and the half
copyrights. Well, I am now <em>sole</em> proprietor, and representing
my works by cyphers, and the author by <em>I</em>, my emblem
might be 00001. I have withdrawn them from sale. This is
rather hard, but perhaps my comet may some time or other

and behold, 10,000. Meantime, enough for me to thank
God that, relatively to my fellow men at least, I have been
“sinned against, not sinning;” and relatively to my Maker,
these afflictions are but penances of mercy, less than the
least of my forfeitures.&mdash;I hope you will soon take pot-luck

<h3><a id="LETTER_177"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 177. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Dec. 13th, 1819.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Accept my affectionate thanks; and, in mine, conceive
those of my housemates included. Would to heaven
I had more than barren thanks to offer you. If you, or
rather your residence, were nearer to me, and I could have
more of your society, I should feel this the less. It was, for
me at least, unfortunate, that, almost every time you have
been here, I should have been engaged in the only way that
I should have suffered to be a pre-engagement, viz. the duties
of friendship. These are now discharged; and whenever
you can give me a day, henceforward, I shall have nothing to
do but to enjoy it. I could not help “winning an hour from
the hard season,” as Milton says, the day before yesterday,
by surrendering my reason to the detail of a day dream, as
I was going over, and after I had gone over, a very pretty<a class="pagenum" id="Page_173" title="173"></a>
house, with beautiful garden and grounds, and a still more
lovely prospect, at the moderate rent of £60 and taxes proportionally low,
discussing the question with myself, as
seriously as if it were actually to be decided, how far the
rising at eight, breakfasting, and riding, driving, or staging
to London, and returning by the stage or otherwise, would
be advantageous to your health; and then the ways and
means of improving and enjoying our Sundays, etc. All I
can say in excuse of these air-built castles is, that they bring
with them no bills for brick and mortar, no quarrels with
the masons, no indignation at the deceits and lures of the
architects, surveyor, etc., when the final expense is found to
treble the amount of the well-paid and costly calculation:
in short, that if they do no honour to the head, they leave
no harm in the heart. And then, <em>poeta fuimus</em>: and the
philosopher, though pressing with the weight of an Etna,
cannot prevent the poet from occasionally changing sides,
and manifesting his existence by smoke traversed by electrical
flashes from the crater.</p>

<p>Have you seen Cobbett’s last number? It is the most
<em>plausible</em> and the best written of anything I have seen from
<em>his</em> pen, and <em>apparently</em> written in a less fiendish spirit than
the average of his weekly effusions. The self-complacency
with which he assumes to himself exclusively, truths which
he can call his own only as a horse-stealer can appropriate a
stolen horse, by adding mutilation and deformities to robbery,
is as <em>artful</em> as it is amusing. Still, however, he has
given great additional publicity to weighty truths, as <em>ex. gr.</em>
the hollowness of <em>commercial</em> wealth; and from whatever
dirty corner or straw moppet the ventriloquist Truth causes
her words to proceed, I not only listen, but must bear witness
that it is Truth talking. His conclusions, however, are
palpably absurd&mdash;give to an over-peopled island the countless
back settlements of America, and countless balloons to
carry thither man and maid, wife and brat, beast and bag<a class="pagenum" id="Page_174" title="174"></a>gage&mdash;and
then we might rationally expect that a general
crash of trade, manufactures, and credit, might be as mere
a summer thunderstorm in Great Britain as he represents it
to be in America.</p>

<p>One deep, most deep, impression of melancholy, did
Cobbett’s letter to Lord Liverpool leave on my mind,&mdash;the
conviction that, wretch as he is, he is an overmatch in intellect
for those, in whose hands Providence, in its retributive
justice, seems to place the destinies of our country; and
who yet rise into respectability, when we compare them with
their parliamentary opponents.</p>

<p>I am commanded to add an especial request, that it may
not be long before you make yourself visible on the banks
of Lake Superior.</p>

<p class="dateline">20th March, 1820.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>You must have thought it strange that I had taken
no notice of so kind a letter from you; but the truth is, I
received the little packet supposing it to contain the Cobbett
only, put it in my pocket for my reading at a leisure
hour, and had not opened it until the day before I last saw
you. Within a few days, I hope to lay myself open to you
in an express letter; till when, I can only say, that the
affectionate interest you have taken in my well-being, has
been not only a comfort but a spur, when I needed both,
and was almost yielding at times to the apprehension, that
I had sacrificed all that the world holds precious, without<a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" title="175"></a>
being able to do any effective good in a higher and nobler
kind. I have sent the three volumes of the <cite>Friend</cite>, with my
MS. corrections, and additions. The largest, that towards
the end of the last <em>philosophical</em> essay in the third volume,
had a two-fold object&mdash;to guard my own character from the
suspicion of pantheistic opinions, or Spinozism (it <em>was</em>
written, though not so much at large, before the work was
printed, and omitted by wilfulness, or such carelessness as
does not fall far short of it); and next, to impress, as far as
I could, the conviction that true philosophy, so far from
having any tendency to unsettle the <em>principles</em> of faith, that
may and ought to be common to all men, does itself
actually require them as its premises; nay, that it supposes
them as its ground.&mdash;I was highly gratified to hear, and
from such a man too as Mr. John Hookham Frere, that a
man of rank, and of a highly cultivated mind, who had become
reluctantly a sceptic, or something more, respecting
the Christian religion, wholly in consequence of studying
Leland, Lardner, Watson, Paley, and other defenders of the
Gospel on the strength of the <em>ex</em>ternal evidences&mdash;not of
Christianity, but of the miracles with which its first preaching
was accompanied&mdash;and of having been taught to regard
the arguments, and mode of proof adopted in the works
above mentioned, as the only rational ones, had read the
<cite>Friend</cite> with great attention, and when he came to the passage
in which I had explained the nature of miracles, their
necessary dependence on a credible religion for their own
credibility, etc., dropped the book (as he himself informed
Mr. Frere), and exclaimed, “Thank God! I can still believe
in the Gospel&mdash;I can yet be a Christian.” The remark that
a miracle, divested of all connection with a doctrine, is
identical with witchcraft, which in all ages has been regarded
with instinctive horror by the human mind, and the reference
to our Lord’s own declarations concerning miracles, were
among the passages that particularly impressed his mind.</p>

in them, and I hope it will not be long before you let us see
you. The people here are occupied in raising and distributing
relief for the poor of the hamlet. On the first day
there were seven hundred and fifty applicants to whom small
sums were given! It would be most un-Christian moroseness
not to feel delight in the unwearied zeal with which every
mode and direction of charity is supported; and I hope
that this is a sunshiny spot in our national character, and that
this virtue will suspend the judgments that threaten the
land. But it would, on the other hand, be wilful blindness
not to see that the lower orders become more and more
improvident in consequence, more and more exchange the
sentiments of Englishmen for the feelings of Lazzaroni.</p>

<p class="p2">I have subjoined the MS. addition mentioned above, and
should wish you to read it with great care and attention in
its proper place; which is, after the word “vacuum,” in

<p class="quote"><a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" title="177"></a>If we thoughtfully review the course of argument pursued, we shall
rest in the following as our sum and ultimatum. The dialectic intellect,
by exertion of its own powers exclusively, may enable us to affirm the
reality of an absolute Being, generally. But here it stops. It can command
neither insight nor conviction concerning the existence (or even
the possibility) of the world as distinct and different from Deity. It
finds itself constrained to confound the Creator with the creation; and
then, cutting the knot it cannot solve, merges the latter in the former,
and denies reality to all finite existence. But here the philosophiser is
condemned to meet with his sure confutation in his own secret dissatisfaction,
and is forced at length to shelter himself from his own importunate
queries in the wretched evasion, that of Nothings no solution
can be required. Wretched indeed, and weak as desperate! Nature
herself&mdash;his own inevitable Nature&mdash;through every organ of sense, compels
his own abused reason to reiterate the demand: How and whence
did this sterile Nothing split or multiply into <em>plurality</em>? Whence this
portentous transnihilation of Nothing into Nothings? What, above all,
is that inward mirror, the human mind, in and for which these Nothings
possess at least a relative existence? Or dost thou wait till, with a more
bitter irony, Pain and Anguish and Remorse ask thee, Are <span class="smcap">we</span> too
Nothings?</p>

<p>O youthful reader! (for such <cite>The Friend</cite> dares anticipate), thou, that
in my mind’s eye, standest beside me, like my own youth! Fresh and
keen as the morning Hunter in the pursuit of Truth, glad and restless
in the feeling of mental growth! O learn early, that if the Head be the
Light of the Heart, the Heart is the Life of the Head: yea, that Consciousness
itself, that Consciousness of which all reasoning is the varied
modification, is but the Reflex of the Conscience when most luminous;
and too often a fatuous vapour, a warmthless bewildering mockery of
Light, exhaled from its corruption or stagnation. Mark the inevitable
result of all <em>consequent</em> reasoning, when the intellect refuses to acknowledge
a higher and deeper ground than itself can supply, and weens to
possess within itself the centre of its own system! From Zeno the
Eleatic to Spinoza, and from Spinoza to Schelling, Oken, and the
German “<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natur-philosophen</em>” of the present day, the Result has been,
and ever must be, <span class="smcap">pantheism</span>, under some one or other of its modes or
disguises: and it is of awful importance to the speculative Inquirer to be
aware, that the seemliest of these modes differs from the most repulsive,
not in its consequences, which in all alike are Atheistic, but only as far
as it evinces the efforts of the individual to hide these consequences
from his own consciousness.</p>

<p>This, then, I again repeat, is our ultimate conclusion. All <em>speculative</em><a class="pagenum" id="Page_178" title="178"></a>
disquisition must begin with <em>Postulates</em>, authorised and substantiated
by the conscience exclusively. From whatever point the reason may
start, whether from the <em>Things that are seen</em> to the One Invisible, or
from the idea of the <span class="smcap">Absolute One</span> to the <em>things that are seen</em>, it will
in either case find a chasm, which the moral being, the <em>spirit</em> and the
<em>religion</em> of man, can alone fill up or overbridge. “<span class="smcap">The life is the
light of man</span>:” and “<span class="smcap">we live by faith</span>.”</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_179"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 179. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Highgate, April 10th, 1820.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>May I venture to obtrude on you what I cannot
intrust to a messenger, much less to the post. Sackville-street
is not I hope more than fifteen or twenty minutes’
walk from your house. It is to inquire if Mr. Caldwell is <em>in
town</em>; if he be, then to leave the letter, and that is all; but
if not, to learn whether he is at his living, and if so, then to
transfer his present address to the letter, and put it into
the nearest General Post Office box. It is of serious importance
to Derwent that the inclosed should reach Mr.
Caldwell with as little delay as possible, or I need not say
that I should not have taxed your time and kindness merely
to make a letter-carrier of you.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening I received a note from Mathews,
which I have inclosed. I took it very kind of him; but to
obtrude myself on Walter Scott, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolentem volentem</em>, and
within a furlong of my own abode, as he knows (for Mr.
Frere told him my address), was a liberty I had no right to
take; and though it would have highly gratified me to have
conversed with a brother bard, and to have renewed on the
mental retina the image of, perhaps, the most extraordinary
man, assuredly the most <em>extraordinary</em> writer, of his age, yet
I dared not purchase the gratification at so high a price as<a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" title="179"></a>
that of risking the respect which I trust has not hitherto
been forfeited by,</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad15">My dear friend,</div>
  <div class="pad5">Your obliged and very affectionate friend,</div>
  <div><span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge</span>.</div>
  <div class="left">T. Allsop, Esq.</div>
</div>

<p>P.S. I had not the least expectation, yet I could not suppress
a sort of fluttering hope, that my letter might have
reached you on Saturday night, and that you might be disengaged
and turn your walk Highgate-ward. You will be
delighted with the affectionate attachment of the two
brothers to each other, the boyish high spirits with manly
independence of intellect, and, in one word, with the
simplicity which is their nature, and the common <em>ground</em> on
which the differences of their mind and characters (for no
two can be more distinct) shoot and play. When I say that
nothing can exceed their fondness for their father, I need
not add that they are impatient to be introduced to you.
And I can offer no better testimony of the rank you hold in
my bosom, my dear Allsop, than the gladness with which I
anticipate their becoming your <em>friends</em>, in the noblest sense
of the word. Would to Heaven their dear sister were with
us, the cup of paternal joy would be full to the brim!
The rapture with which both Hartley and Derwent talk
of her, quite affects Mrs. Gillman, who has always felt with
a sort of lofty yet refined enthusiasm respecting the relations
of an only sister to her brothers. Of all women
I ever knew, Mrs. G. is the woman who seems to have
been framed by Nature for a heroine in that rare species
of love which subsists in a tri-unity of the heart, the moral
sense, and the faculty, corresponding to what Spurzheim
calls the organ of <em>ideality</em>. What in other women is <em>refinement</em>
exists in her as by implication, and, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">à fortiori</em>, in a
native <em>fineness</em> of character. She often represents to my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_180" title="180"></a>
mind the best parts of the Spanish Santa Teresa, ladyhood
of nature.</p>

<p><em>Vexation!</em> and Mrs. Gillman has this moment burnt
Mathews’ note. The purport, however, was as follows:&mdash;“I
have just received a note from Terry, informing me that Sir
Walter Scott will call upon me to-morrow morning (<em>i.e.</em>
Sunday) at half-past eleven. Will you contrive to be here at
the same time? Perhaps the promise of your company may
induce Sir Walter to appoint a day on which he will dine
with me before he returns to the north.”</p>

<p>Now as Scott had asked Terry for my address on his first
arrival in town, it is not <em>impossible</em>, though not very probable,
that Terry may have said&mdash;“You will meet Coleridge at
Mathews’s,” though I was not entitled to presume this. The
bottom of all this, my dear friend, is neither more nor less
than as follows:&mdash;I seem to feel that I <em>ought</em> to feel more
desire to see an extraordinary man than I really do feel;
and I do not wish to appear to two or three persons (as
the Mr. Freres, William Rose, etc.), as if I cherished any
dislike to Scott respecting the <cite>Christabel</cite>, and generally an
increasing dislike to appear out of the common and natural
mode of thinking and acting. All this is, I own, sad weakness,
but I am weary of <em>dyspathy</em>.</p>


<p class="p2">It will be seen from the postscript of the last letter that
Hartley and Derwent, Coleridge’s sons, were on a visit to
Highgate.]</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" title="181"></a><a id="CHAP_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="subtitle">SIR WALTER SCOTT</span></h2>


<p>[Coleridge and Sir Walter Scott met at least three
times during their lives, once in 1807,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> once in 1820,
and again in 1828. Sir Walter was cognizant of the genius
of Coleridge both as the author of <cite>Christabel</cite> and of the
translation of <cite>Wallenstein</cite>, which he praised highly; and he
had on the last occasion of their meeting to acknowledge
Coleridge’s extraordinary colloquial power. His tribute to
the genius of Coleridge is well known to readers of Lockhart’s
<cite>Life of Scott</cite>. The next letter to Allsop contains
Coleridge’s estimate of Scott. No greater contrast than
Scott and Coleridge as literary men, the two greatest, with
the exception of Goethe, of their generation, could be
conceived. Scott, successful, the darling of the hour, reaping
thousands of pounds for his literary output and almost
unable to keep pace with the demand for his creations;
Coleridge, always unable to obtain anything like remuneration
for his more profound and original work, and never the
possessor in advance of £50 which he could call his own.
And yet, both were the victims of a fate which seemed to
brood over them; and, after all, it is difficult to say from a
worldly point of view which was really the more successful,
the creator of a whole gallery of characters known throughout
Anglo-Saxondom as household beings, or the other the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" title="182"></a>
disseminator of the most fruitful ideas in all departments of
human thought.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_180"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 180. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Highgate, April 8th, 1820.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>It is not the least advantage of friendship, that by
communicating our thoughts to another, we render them
distinct to ourselves, and reduce the subjects of our sorrow
and anxiety to their just magnitude for our own contemplation.</p>

<p>As long as we inly brood over a misfortune (there being
no divisions or separate circumscriptions in things of mind,
no <em>proper</em> beginning nor ending to any thought, on the one
hand; and, on the other, the confluence of our recollections
being determined far more by sameness or similarity of the
feelings that have been produced by them, than by any
positive resemblance or connection between the things
themselves that are thus recalled to our attention) we establish
a centre, as it were, a sort of nucleus in the reservoir of
the soul; and toward this, needle shoots after needle,
cluster points on cluster points, from all parts of contained
fluid, and in all directions, till the mind with its best
faculties is locked up in one ungenial frost. I cannot adequately
express the state of feeling in which I wrote my last
letter; the letter itself, I doubt not, bore evidence of its
<em>nest</em> and mode of incubation, as certain birds and lizards
drag along with them part of the egg-shells from which they
had forced their way. Still one good end was answered. I
had made a clearance, so far as to have my head in light
and my eyes open; and your answer, every way worthy of
you, has removed the rest.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" title="183"></a></p>

<p>But before I enter on this subject, permit me to refer to
some points of <em>comparative</em> indifference, lest I should forget
them altogether. I occasioned you to misconceive me
respecting Sir Walter Scott. My purpose was to bring proofs
of the energetic or inenergetic state of the minds of men,
induced by the excess and unintermitted action of stimulating
events and circumstances,&mdash;revolutions, battles, <em>newspapers</em>,
mobs, sedition and treason trials, public harangues,
meetings, dinners; the necessity in every individual of ever
increasing activity and anxiety in the improvement of his
estate, trade, etc., in proportion to the decrease of the
actual value of money, to the multiplication of competitors,
and to the almost compulsory expedience of expense, and
prominence, even as the means of obtaining or retaining
competence; the consequent craving after amusement as
proper <em>relaxation</em>, as <em>rest</em> freed from the tedium of vacancy;
and, again, after such knowledge and such acquirements as
are <em>ready coin</em>, that will pass <em>at once</em>, unweighed and unassayed;
to the unexampled facilities afforded for this end
by reviews, magazines, etc., etc. The theatres, to which few
go to see <em>a play</em>, but to see Master Betty or Mr. Kean, or
some one individual in some <em>one</em> part: and the single fact
that our neighbour, Mathews, has taken more, night after
night, than both the regular theatres conjointly, and when
the best comedies or whole plays have been acted at each
house, and those by excellent comedians, would have yielded
a striking instance, and illustration of my position. But I
chose an example in literature, as more in point for the
subject of my particular remarks, and because every man of genius,
who is born for his age, and capable of acting <em>immediately</em>
and widely on that age, must of necessity <em>reflect</em> the age in
the first instance, though as far as he is a man of genius, he
will doubtless be himself reflected by it reciprocally. Now I
selected Scott for the very reason, that I do hold him for a
man of <em>very extraordinary</em> powers; and when I say that I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" title="184"></a>
have read the far greater part of his novels twice, and several
three times over, with undiminished pleasure and interest;
and that, in my reprobation of the <cite>Bride of Lammermoor</cite>
(with the exception, however, of the almost Shakspearian
old witch-wives at the funeral) and of the <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>, I mean
to imply the grounds of my admiration of the others, and
the permanent nature of the interest which they excite. In
a word, I am far from thinking that <cite>Old Mortality</cite> or <cite>Guy
Mannering</cite> would have been less admired in the age of
Sterne, Fielding, and Richardson, than they are in the
present times; but only that Sterne, etc., would not have
had the same <em>immediate</em> popularity in the present day as in
their own less stimulated and, therefore, less languid reading
world.</p>

<p>Of Sir Walter Scott’s poems I cannot speak so highly,
still less of the Poetry in his <cite>Poems</cite>; though even in these
the power of presenting the most numerous figures, and
figures with the most complex movements, and under rapid
succession, in <em>true picturesque unity</em>, attests true and peculiar
genius. You cannot imagine with how much pain I used,
many years ago, to hear &mdash;&mdash;’s contemptuous assertions
respecting Scott; and if I mistake not, I have yet the fragments
of the rough draft of a letter written by me so long
ago as my first lectures at the London Philosophical
Society, Fetter Lane, and on the backs of the unused admission
tickets.</p>

<p>One more remark. My criticism was <em>confined</em> to the one
point of the higher degree of intellectual activity implied in
the reading and admiration of Fielding, Richardson, and
Sterne;&mdash;in moral, or, if that be too high and inwardly a
word, in <em>mannerly</em> manliness of taste the present age and its
<em>best</em> writers have the decided advantage, and I sincerely trust
that Walter Scott’s readers would be as little disposed to
relish the stupid lechery of the courtship of Widow Wadman,
as Scott himself would be capable of presenting it.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" title="185"></a>
And, that though I cannot pretend to have found in any of
these novels a character that even approaches in genius, in
truth of conception, or boldness and freshness of execution,
to Parson Adams, Blifil, Strap, Lieutenant Bowling, Mr.
Shandy, Uncle Toby and Trim, and Lovelace; and though
Scott’s <em>female</em> characters will not, even the very best, bear a
comparison with Miss Byron, Clementina Emily, in Sir
Charles Grandison; nor the comic ones with Tabitha
Bramble, or with Betty (in Mrs. Bennet’s <cite>Beggar Girl</cite>);
and though, by the use of the Scotch dialect, by Ossianic
mock-highland motley-heroic, and by extracts from the
printed sermons, memoirs, etc., of the fanatic preachers,
there is a good deal of <em>false effect</em> and stage trick: still the
number of characters <em>so good</em> produced by one man, and in
so rapid a succession, must ever remain an illustrious
phenomenon in literature, after all the subtractions for those
borrowed from English and German sources, or compounded
by blending two or three of the old drama into one&mdash;<em>ex.
gr.</em> the Caleb in the <cite>Bride of Lammermoor</cite>.</p>

<p>Scott’s great merit, and, at the same time, his <em>felicity</em>, and
the true solution of the long-sustained <em>interest</em> novel after
novel excited, lie in the nature of the subject; not merely,
or even chiefly, because the struggle between the Stuarts
and the Presbyterians and sectaries, is still in lively memory,
and the passions of the adherency to the former, if not the
adherency itself, extant in our own fathers’ or grandfathers’
times; nor yet (though this is of great weight) because the language,
manners, etc., introduced are sufficiently different from
our own for <em>poignancy</em>, and yet sufficiently near and similar for
sympathy; nor yet because, for the same reason, the author,
speaking, reflecting, and descanting in his own person, remains
still (to adopt a painter’s phrase) in sufficient <em>keeping</em>
with his subject matter, while his characters can both talk
and feel interesting to <em>us</em> as men, without recourse to <em>antiquarian</em>
interest, and nevertheless without moral anachron<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" title="186"></a>ism
(in all which points the <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> is so wofully the contrary,
for what Englishman cares for Saxon or Norman, both
brutal invaders, more than for Chinese and Cochin-Chinese?)&mdash;yet
great as all these causes are, the essential wisdom and
happiness of the subject consists in this,&mdash;that the contest
between the loyalists and their opponents can never be
<em>obsolete</em>, for it is the contest between the two great moving
principles of social humanity; religious adherence to the
past and the ancient, the desire and the admiration of permanence,
on the one hand; and the passion for increase of
knowledge, for truth, as the offspring of reason&mdash;in short,
the mighty instincts of <em>progression</em> and <em>free agency</em>, on the
other. In all subjects of deep and lasting interest, you will
detect a struggle between two opposites, two polar forces,
both of which are alike necessary to our human well-being,
and necessary each to the continued existence of the other.
Well, therefore, may we contemplate with intense feelings
those whirlwinds which are for free agents the appointed
means, and the only possible condition of that equilibrium
in which our moral Being subsists; while the disturbance of
the same constitutes our sense of life. Thus in the ancient
Tragedy, the lofty struggle between irresistible fate, and unconquerable
free will, which finds its equilibrium in the
Providence and the future retribution of Christianity. If,
instead of a contest between Saxons and Normans, or the
Fantees and Ashantees,&mdash;a mere contest of indifferents! of
minim surges in a boiling fish-kettle,&mdash;Walter Scott had
taken the struggle between the men of arts and the men of
arms in the time of Becket, and made us feel how much to
claim our well-wishing there was in the cause and character
of the priestly and papal party, no less than in those of
Henry and his knights, he would have opened a new mine,
instead of translating into Leadenhall Street Minerva Library
sentences, a cento of the most common incidents of the
stately self-congruous romances of D’Urfe, Scuderi, etc.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" title="187"></a>
N.B. I have not read the <cite>Monastery</cite>, but I suspect that the
thought or element of the faery work is from the German.
I perceive from that passage in the <cite>Old Mortality</cite>, where
Morton is discovered by old Alice in consequence of calling
his dog Elphin, that Walter Scott has been reading Tieck’s
<cite>Phantasies</cite> (a collection of faery or witch tales), from which
both the incident and name is borrowed.</p>

<p>I forget whether I ever mentioned to you, that some
eighteen months ago I had planned and half collected, half
manufactured and invented a work, to be entitled <em>The
Weather</em>-<span class="smcap">bound</span> <cite>Traveller</cite>; or, Histories, Lays, Legends,
Incidents, Anecdotes, and Remarks, contributed during a
detention in one of the Hebrides, recorded by their Secretary,
Lory McHaroldson, Senachy in the Isle of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The principle of the work I had thus expressed in the first
chapter:&mdash;“Though not <em>fact</em>, must it needs be false? These
things have a truth of their own, if we but knew how to look
for it. There is a <em>humanity</em> (meaning by this word whatever
contradistinguishes man), there is a humanity common to
all periods of life, which each <em>period</em> from childhood has its
own way of representing. Hence, in whatever laid firm
hold of us in early life, there lurks an interest and a charm
for our maturest years,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> but which <em>he</em> will never draw forth,
who, content with mimicking the unessential, though natural
defects of thought and expression, has not the skill to
remove the <em>childish</em>, yet leave the <em>childlike</em> untouched. Let
each of us then relate that which has left the deepest impression
on his mind, at whatever period of his life he may
have seen, heard, or read it; but let him tell it in accordance
with the <em>present state</em> of his intellect and feelings, even<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" title="188"></a>
as he has, perhaps (Alnaschar-like), acted it over again by
the parlour fire-side of a rustic inn, with the fire and the
candles for his only companions.”</p>

<p>On the hope of my Lectures answering, I had intended to
have done this work out of hand, dedicating the most genial
hours to the completion of <cite>Christabel</cite>, in the belief that in
the former I should be rekindling the feeling, and recalling
the state of mind, suitable to the latter.&mdash;But the Hope was
vain.</p>

<p>In stating the names and probable size of my works, I by
no means meant any reference to the mode of their publication;
I merely wished to communicate to you the amount
of my labours. In two moderate volumes it was my intention
to comprise all those more prominent and systematic
parts of my lucubrations on Shakspeare as should be published
(in the first instance at least, in the form of books),
and having selected and arranged them, to send the more
particular illustrations and analysis to some respectable
magazine. In like manner, I proposed to include the philosophical
critiques on Dante, Milton, Cervantes, etc., in a
series of Letters entitled <cite>The Reviewer in Exile, or Critic
confined to an Old Library</cite>. Provided the truths (which are,
I dare affirm, original, and all tending to the same principles,
and proving the endless fertility of true principle, and
the decision and power of growth which it communicates to
all the faculties of the mind) are but in existence, and to be
read by such as might wish to read, I have no choice as to
the mode; nay, I should prefer that mode which most multiplied
the chances.&mdash;So too as to the order.&mdash;For <em>many</em>
reasons, it had been my wish to commence with the <cite>Theological
Letters</cite>: one, and not the least, is the strong desire I
have to put you and Hartley and Derwent Coleridge in full
possession of my whole Christian creed, with the grounds of
reason and authority on which it rests; but especially to
unfold the true “glorious liberty of the Gospel,” by showing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" title="189"></a>
the distinction between doctrinal faith and its sources and
historical belief, with their reciprocal action on each other;
and thus, on the one hand, to do away (with) the servile superstition
which makes men <em>Bibliolators</em>, and yet hides from
them the proper excellences, the one continued revelation
of the Bible documents, which they idolise; and, on the
other hand, to expose, in its native worthlessness, the so-called
evidences of Christianity first brought into <em>toleration</em>
by Arminius, and into fashion by Grotius and the Socinian
divines; for as such I consider all those who preach and
teach in the spirit of Socinianism, though even in the outward
form of a defence of the thirty-nine articles.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted by the arrival of my sons, Hartley
and Derwent, the latter of whom I had not seen for so
dreary a time. I promise myself great pleasure in introducing
him to you. Hartley you have already met. Indeed,
I am so desirous of this, that I will defer what I have to
add, that I may put this letter in the post, time enough for
you to receive it this evening; saying only, that it was not
my purpose to have had any further communication on the
subject but with Mr. Frere, and with him only as a counsellor.
Let me see you as soon as you can and as often. I
shall be better able hereafter to talk with you than to write
to you on the contents of your last.</p>

<p>Hartley Coleridge had been sent by the generosity of his
uncles and Poole, and other friends, to Oxford, and had
gained a Fellowship at Oriel in 1819; but at the close of his
probationary year forfeited his fellowship on the ground of
intemperance. This calamity fell upon Coleridge with great
severity. The following letters refer to it.</p>

<p>My very dear Friend,</p>

<p>Before I opened your letter, or rather before I gave
it to my best sister, and, under God, best comforter, to
open, a very heavy affliction came upon me with all the
aggravations of surprise, sudden as a peal of thunder from a
cloudless sky.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Alas! both Mr. and Mrs. Gillman had spoken to him with
all the earnestness of the fondest parents; his cousins had
warned him, and I (long ago) had written to him, conjuring
him to reflect with what a poisoned dagger it would arm my
enemies: yea, and the phantoms that, half-<em>counterfeiting</em>,
half-expounding the conscience, would persecute my sleep.
My conscience indeed bears me witness, that from the time
I quitted Cambridge, no human being was more indifferent
to the pleasures of the table than myself, or less needed any
stimulation to my spirits; and that by a most unhappy
quackery, after having been almost bedrid for six months
with swollen knees and other distressing symptoms of disordered
digestive functions, and through that most pernicious
form of ignorance, medical half-knowledge, I was <em>seduced</em>
into the use of narcotics, not secretly, but (such was my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_191" title="191"></a>
ignorance) openly and exultingly, as one who had discovered
and was never weary of recommending, a grand panacea
and saw not the truth till my <em>body</em> had contracted a habit
and a necessity; and that, even to the latest, my responsibility
is for cowardice, and defect of fortitude, not for the least
craving after gratification or pleasurable sensation of any
sort, but for yielding to pain, terror, and haunting bewilderment.
But this I say to <em>man</em> only, who knows only what has
been yielded not what has been resisted: before God I have
but one voice&mdash;“Mercy! mercy! woe is me.”&mdash;This was the
sin of his nature, and this has been fostered by the culpable
indulgence, at least non-interference, on my part; while, in
a different quarter, contempt of the self-<em>interest</em> he saw
seduced him unconsciously into <em>selfishness</em>.</p>

<p>Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may not pass such
another night as the last. While I am awake and retain my
reasoning powers, the pang is gnawing, but I am, except for
a fitful moment or two, tranquil; it is the howling wilderness
of sleep that I dread.</p>

<p>I am most reluctant thus to transplant the thorns from my
own pillow to yours, but sooner or later you must know it,
and how else could I explain to you the incapability I am
under of answering your letter? For the present (my late
visitation and sorrow out of the question) my anxiety is respecting
your health. Mr. Gillman feels satisfied that there
is nothing in your case symptomatic of aught more dangerous
than irritable, and at present disordered, organs of
digestion, requiring indeed great care, but by no means incompatible
with comfortable health on the whole. Would to
God! that your uncle lived near Highgate, or that we were
settled near Clapham. Most anxious am I&mdash;(for I am sure
I do not <em>over</em>rate Gillman’s medical skill and sound medical
good sense, and have had every possible opportunity of
satisfying myself on this head, <em>comparatively</em> as well as positively,
from my intimate acquaintance with so many medical<a class="pagenum" id="Page_192" title="192"></a>
men in the course of my life)&mdash;I am most anxious that you
should not apply to any medical practitioner at Clapham,
till you have consulted some physician recommended by
Gillman, and with whom our friend might have some confidential
conversation.&mdash;The next earnest petition I make to
you,&mdash;for should I lose <em>you</em> from this world, I fear that
religious terrors would shake my strength of mind, and to
how many are you, must you be, very dear,&mdash;is that you
would stay in the country as long as is <em>morally</em> practicable.
Let nothing but <em>coercive</em> motives have weight with you; a
month’s tranquillity in pure air (O! that I could spend that
month with you, with no greater efforts of mental or bodily
exercise than would exhilarate both body and mind) might
save you many months’ interrupted and half-effective labour.</p>

<p>If any thoughts occur to you at Clapham on which it
would amuse or gratify you to have my notions, write to me,
and I shall be served by having something to think and
write about not connected with myself. But, at all events,
write as often as you can, and as much as (but not a syllable
more than) you ought. Need I say how unspeakably dear
you are to your, you must not refuse me to say in heart,</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_182"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 182. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">August 8th, 1820.</p>

<p>My very Dear Friend,</p>

<p>Neither indolence nor procrastination have had any
place among the causes of my silence, least of all either
yourself, or the subject of your letter, or the purpose of
answering it, having been absent from my thoughts. You
may with almost literal truth attribute it to want of time,
from the number, quantity, and quality of my engagements,
the necessity of several journeys <em>to</em> and (still worse) <em>in</em> town<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" title="193"></a>
being the largest waster of time and spirits. At length I have
settled J. for the next six or eight weeks with Mr. Montague,
where he is engaged on an <cite>Essay on the Principles of Taste
in relation to Metre and Rhythm</cite>, containing, first, a new
scheme of prosody, as applied to the choral and lyrical
stanzas of the Greek drama; secondly, the possibility of improving
and enriching our English versification by digging
in the original mines, viz.&mdash;the tunes of nature and impassioned
conversation, both of which may be illustrated
from Mr. Frere’s <cite>Aristophanic Poems</cite>. I have been working
hard to bring together for him the notes, etc., that I had
prepared on this subject. E. has been ill, and even now is
far from well. There are some persons&mdash;I have known
several&mdash;who, when they find themselves uncomfortable,
take up the pen and transfer as much discomfort as they
can to their absent friends. But I know only one of this
sort, who, as soon as they take up the pen, instantly become
<em>dolorous</em>, however smug, snug, and cheerful the minute
before and the minute after.</p>

<p>Now just such is Mrs. D., God bless her! and she has
been writing letter after letter to E. about J., and every discomfortable
recollection and anticipation that she could
conjure up, that she has completely overset him. <em>This must
not be.</em> Mr. Gillman, too, has been <em>out</em> of <em>sorts</em>, but at this
present we are all better. I at least am as well as I ever am,
and my regular employment, in which Mr. Green is weekly
my amanuensis, the work on the books of the Old and New
Testaments introduced by the assumptions and postulates
required as the pre-conditions of a fair examination of
Christianity as a scheme of doctrines, precepts, and histories,
drawn or at least deducible from these books. And
now, in the narrative line, I have only to add that Mrs.
Gillman desires to be affectionately remembered to you, and
bids me entreat you to stay <em>away as long</em> as you possibly
can, provided it be from <em>London</em> as well as from Highgate.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_194" title="194"></a>Would to heaven I were with you! In a few days you
should see that the spirit of the mountaineer is not yet
utterly extinct in me. Wordsworth has remarked (in the
<cite>Brothers</cite>, I believe),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The thought of death sits light upon the man</div>
    <div class="line">That has been bred, and dies among the mountains.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But I fear that this, like some other few of Wordsworth’s
<em>many</em> striking passages, means less than it seems, or rather
promises to mean. Poets (especially if philosophers too) are
apt to represent the effect made upon themselves as general;
the geese of Phœbus are all swans; and Wordsworth’s shepherds
and estates men are Wordsworth’s, even (as in old
Michael) in the unpoetic traits of character. Whether mountains
have any particular effect on the native inhabitants by
virtue of being mountains exclusively, and what that effect
is, would be a difficult problem. If independent tribes,
mountaineers are robbers of the lowlanders; brave, active,
and with all the usual warlike good and bad qualities that
result from habits of adventurous robbery. Add clanship
and the superstitions that are the surviving <em>precipitate</em> of an
established religion, both which are common to the uncivilised
Celtic tribes, in plain no less than in mountain, and
you have the Scottish Highlanders. But where the inhabitants
exist as states, or civilised parts of civilised states, they
appear to be in mind and character just what their condition
and employments would render them in level plain, the
same as amid Alpine heights. At least the influence acts indirectly
only, as far as the mountains are the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa causæ</em> or
occasion of a <em>pastoral</em> life instead of an agricultural; thus
combining a lax and common property, possessed by a
whole district, with small hereditary estates sacred to each,
while the properties in sheep seem to partake of both characters.
And truly, to this circumstance, aided by the
favourable action of a necessarily scanty population (for <em>man</em><a class="pagenum" id="Page_195" title="195"></a>
is an oak that wants room, not a <em>plantation tree</em>), we must
attribute whatever superiority the mountaineers of Cumberland
and Westmoreland and of the Swiss and Tyrolese Alps
possess, as the shocking contrast of the Welsh mountaineers
too clearly evinces. But this subject I have discussed, and
(if I do not flatter myself) satisfactorily, in the Literary
Life, and I will not conceal from <em>you</em> that this inferred
dependency of the human soul on accidents of birth-place
and abode, together with the vague, misty, rather than
mystic, confusion of God with the world, and the accompanying
nature-worship, of which the asserted dependence
forms a part, is the trait in Wordsworth’s poetic works that I
most dislike as unhealthful, and denounce as contagious;
while the odd introduction of the popular, almost the vulgar,
religion in his later publications (the popping in, as Hartley
says, of the old man with a beard), suggests the painful suspicion
of worldly prudence&mdash;at best a justification of masking
truth (which, in fact, is a falsehood substituted for
a truth withheld) on plea of expediency&mdash;carried into
religion. At least it conjures up to my fancy a sort of <em>Janus</em>
head of Spinoza and Dr. Watts, or “I and my brother the
dean.”</p>

<p>Permit me, then, in the place of the two lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The thought of death sits easy on the man,</div>
    <div class="line">Who hath been bred, and dies among the mountains,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>to say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The thought of death sits easy on the man,</div>
    <div class="line">Whose earnest <em>will</em> hath lived among the deathless.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And I can perhaps build upon this foundation an answer to
the question, which would deeply interest me, by whomever
put, and pained me only because it was put by <em>you</em>; <em>i.e.</em>
because I feared it might be the inspiration of ill health, and
am jealous of any <em>consenting</em> of that inward will which, with
some mysterious germination, moves in the Bethesda pool of
our animal life, to withdraw its resistance. For the soul,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" title="196"></a>
among its other regalia, has an energetic veto against all
undermining of the constitution, and among these, as not
the least insidious, I consider the thoughts and hauntings
that tamper with the love of life.</p>

<p>Do not so! you <em>would not</em>, if I could transfer into you, in
all its depth and liveliness, the sense what a hope, promise,
impulse, you are to me in my present efforts to realise my
past labours; and by building up the temple,&mdash;the shaped
stones, beams, pillars, yea, the graven ornaments and the
connecting clamps of which have been piled up by me, only
in too great abundance,&mdash;to enable you and my two (may I
not say other) sons to affirm,&mdash;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vivit, quia non frustra vixit.</em>

In reading an extract in the German Encyclopædia from
Dobrizhoffer’s most interesting account of the Abiponenses,
a savage tribe in Paraguay, houseless, yet in person and in
morals the noblest of savage tribes; who, when first known
by Europeans, amounted to 100,000 warriors, yet have a
tradition that they were but the relic of a far more numerous
community, and who by wars with other savage tribes, and
by intestine feuds among themselves, are now dwindled to a
thousand (men, women, and children do not exceed five
thousand), it struck me with distinct remembrance&mdash;first,
that this is the history of <em>all</em> savages tribes; and, second, that
all tribes <em>are</em> savage that have not a positive religion defecated
from witchcraft, and an established priesthood contra-distinguished
from individual conjurers. Nay, the islands of
the Pacific (the Polynesia, which sooner or later the swift
and silent masonry of the coral worms will compact into a
rival continent, into a <em>fifth quarter</em> of the world), blest with
all the plenties of nature, and enjoying an immunity from all
the ordinary dangers of savage life, were many of them
utterly dispeopled since their first discovery, and wholly by
their own feuds and vices; nay, that their bread-fruit tree and
their delicious and healthful climate had only made the process
of mutual destruction and self-destruction more hateful,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_197" title="197"></a>
more basely sensual. This, therefore, I assume as an undoubted
fact of history; and from this, as a portion of the
history of <em>men</em>, I draw a new (to my knowledge, at least, a
new) series of proofs of several, I <em>might</em> say of <em>all</em>, the positions
of pre-eminent importance and interest more than
vital; a series which, taken in harmonious counterpart to a
prior series drawn from <em>interior</em> history (the history of <em>man</em>),
the documents of which are to be found only in the archives
of each individual’s own consciousness, will form a complete
<em>whole</em>&mdash;a system of evidence, consisting of two correspondent
worlds, as it were, correlative and mutually potentiating,
yet each integral and self-subsistent&mdash;having the same correlation,
as the geometry and the observations, or the metaphysics
and the physics, of astronomy. If I can thus demonstrate
the truth of the doctrine of existence after the present
life, it is not improbable that some rays of light may fall on
the question, what <em>state</em> of existence it may be reasonably
supposed to be? At all events, we shall, I trust, be enabled
to determine negatively, what it can <em>not</em> be for <em>any</em>; and <em>for
whom</em> this or that, which does not appear universally precluded,
is yet <em>for them</em> precluded. In plainer words, what can
<em>not</em> be, universally speaking; second, what may be; third,
what the differences may be for different individuals, within
the limits prescribed in No. 2; fourth, what scheme of
embodied representation of the future state (our <em>reason</em> not
forbidding the same) is recommended by the truest analogies;
and, fifth, what scheme it is best to combine with
our belief of a hereafter, as most conducive to the growth
and cultivation of our collective faculties in this life, or of
each in the order of its comparative worth, value, and permanence.
This I must defer to another letter, for I cannot
let another post pass by, without your knowing that we are
all thinking of and loving you.</p>

<p class="dateline">Highgate, Oct. 11th, 1820.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>You will think it childish in me, and more savouring
of a jealous boarding-school miss than a friend and a philosopher,
when I confess that the “with great respect, your
obliged and grateful...,” gave me pain. But I did not return
from Mr. Cooper’s, at whose house we all dined, till
near midnight, and did not open the packet till this morning
after getting out of bed; and this you know is the hour in
which the cat-organ of an irritable viscerage is substituted
for the brain as the mind’s instrument.</p>

<p>The Cobbett is assuredly a strong and battering production
throughout, and in the best bad style of this political
rhinoceros, with his coat armour of dry and wet mud, and
his one horn of brutal strength on the nose of scorn and
hate; not to forget the flaying rasp of his tongue! There is
one article of his invective, however, from which I cannot
withhold my vote of consent: that I mean which respects
Mr. Brougham’s hollow complimentary phrases to the ministry
and the House of Lords. On expressing my regret that
his poor hoaxed and hunted client had been lured or terrified
into the nets of the revolutionists, and had taken the topmost
perch, as the flaring, screaming <em>maccaw</em>, in the clamorous
aviary of faction, Sheriff Williams, who dined with us,
premising that his <em>wishes</em> accorded with mine, declared
himself, however fully and deeply convinced, that, without
this alliance, the Queen must have been overwhelmed, not
wholly or even chiefly from the strength of the party itself,
but because, without the activity, enthusiasm, and combination,
peculiar to the reformists, her case, in all its detail and
with all its appendages, would never have had that notoriety
so beyond example universal; which (to translate Sheriff<a class="pagenum" id="Page_199" title="199"></a>
Williams into Poet Coleridge), with kettle drum reveillée, had
echoed through the mine and the coal-pit, which had lifted
the latch of every cottage, and thundered with no run-away
knock at Carlton Palace. I could only reply, that I had
never yet seen, heard, or read of any advantage in the long
run, occurring to a good cause from an unholy alliance with
evil passions and incongruous or alien purposes. It was ever
heavy on my heart, that the people, alike high and low, do
perish for lack of knowledge; that both sheep and shepherd,
the Flocks and the Pastors, go astray among swamps and in
desolate places, for want of the <em>Truth</em>, the <em>whole</em> Truth, and
nothing but the Truth; and that the sacred motto, which I
had adopted for my first political publication (<cite>The Watchman</cite>),
would be the aspiration of my death-bed&mdash;<span class="smcap">That all
may know the truth; and that the truth may make
us free</span>.</p>

<p>I observed farther, that in bodies of men, not accidentally
collected nor promiscuously, but such as our House
of Lords, the usual effect of terror was, first, self-justification
as to the worst of their past violent and unconstitutional
measures; and, next, a desperate belief that their safety
would be still more endangered by giving way than by
plunging onward; that, if they must fall, they would fall
in that way in which they might take vengeance on the occasion
of the mischief. If the proposition be either ... or
..., and the latter blank is to be filled up by <em>a Civil War</em>,
what shall we put for the former, to make our duty to submit
to it deniable or even doubtful? A Legislature permitted
by us to stand in the eye of the whole civilised World as the
representative of our country, corruptly and ruthlessly pandering
to an Individual’s Lust and Hate! Open Hostility
to Innocence, and the subversion of justice, a shameless
trampling under foot of the Laws of God and the Principles
of the Constitution, in the name and against the known will
of the Nation! Well! if anything, it must be this! It is a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_200" title="200"></a>
decision, compared with which the sentence of the elder
Brutus were a grief for which an onion might supply the
tears. A dreadful decision! But be it so!&mdash;How much more
then are we bound to be careful, that no conduct of our
own, no assent or countenance given by us to the violence
of others, no want of courage and alertness in denouncing
the same, should have the least tendency to bring about an
act or event, dire enough to justify a civil war for its preventive!
I produced, as you may suppose, but small effect;
and yet your very note enforces the truth of my reply&mdash;for
these very answers of the Queen’s conjointly with her plebicolar
(or plebicolous) Clap-Trapperies in the live puppet-show
of wicked Punch and his wife, that has come back
again, and the devil on all sides, make it impossible for me
to ask you, as I otherwise should have done,&mdash;What proof,
proveably independent of the calumny plot, have we of any
want of delicacy in the Queen? What act or form of
demeanour can be adduced on competent testimony, from
which we are forced or entitled to infer innate Coarseness, if
not Grossness? The dire disclosure of the extent and extremes
to which Calumny may be carried&mdash;and perhaps the
recent persecution of poor dear ... mixes its workings&mdash;makes
me credulous in incredulity; so that I am almost
prepared to reverse the proverb, and think that “what every
one says must be a lie!” They put a body up to the nostrils
in the dunghill of reeking slander, and then exclaim: There
is no smoke without some fire!</p>

<p>It is my purpose, God willing! to leave this place on
Friday, so as to take an afternoon coach, if any such there
be, or the Oxford mail, as the dernier resource&mdash;and so to
be in Oxford by Saturday morning, while my letter, which is
unfortunately a very long one (and I could not make it otherwise),
will reach Dr. Coplestone, if arrived, on Friday
morning; thus giving him a day’s preparation for the personal
interview. How long my absence from Highgate may<a class="pagenum" id="Page_201" title="201"></a>
be, I cannot of course predetermine; certainly not an hour
beyond what [Hartley]’s interest requires.</p>

not add&mdash;</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Sheriff Williams is apparently a very worthy, and

M’Evoy and a Mr. De Vains of Liverpool; so wonderful
as to threaten the stoppage even of my Bank of Faith.</p>

<p>Doubtless nothing can be more delightful to me, independent
of Mrs. Gillman’s kind but unnecessary anxieties,
than to go to Oxford with you. Nay, though it will be but

much, yet I should even ask it of you if I were quite sure,

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>It will please you, though I scarcely know whether
the pleasure is worth the carriage, to know that my own
feelings and convictions were, from the very commencement
of this unhappy affair, viz.&mdash;the terms proposed to the
Queen by Lord Hutchinson, in coincidence with your present
suggestion, and that I actually began an essay, and
proposed a sort of <em>diary</em>, <em>i.e.</em> remarks moral and political,
according as the events of the day suggested them. But
Mr. Gillman dissuaded me. Again, about five weeks ago I
had written a letter to Conder, the editor of the <cite>Eclectic

<div class="dateline">Nov. 27, 1820.</div>

<p>My very dear Friend,</p>

<p>I have been more than usually unwell, with great
depression of spirits, loss of appetite, frequent sickness, and
a harassing pain in my left knee; and at the same time
anxious to preclude, as much as I can, the ill effects of poor
J.’s procrastination&mdash;indolence it is not, for he is busy
enough in his own way, and rapidly bringing together materials
for his future credit as a man of letters and a poet, but
shrinking from all things connected with painful associations,
and of that morbid temperament, which I too well
understand, that renders what would be motives for men in
general, narcotics for him, in exact proportion to their
strength; and this I could only do by taking on myself as
much of the document writing as was contrivable. Besides
this, I have latterly felt increasingly anxious to avail myself
of every moment that ill health left me, to get forward with
my <cite>Logic</cite> and with my <cite>Assertion of Religion</cite>.</p>

<p>Nay, foolish though it be, I cannot prevent my mind
from being affected by the alarming state of public affairs,
and, as it appears to me, the want of stable principle even
in the chiefs of the party that seem to feel aright, yet chirrup
like crickets in warmth without light.</p>

<p>The consequence of all this is, that I not only have<a class="pagenum" id="Page_204" title="204"></a>
deferred writing to you, but have played the procrastinator
with myself, even in giving attention to your very interesting
letter. For minor things your kindness and kind remembrances
are so habitual, that my acknowledgments you
cannot but take for granted. Mr. Gillman has been ill;
Mrs. Gillman&mdash;and this leads me to the particular object of
this letter&mdash;expresses aloud and earnestly what I feel no
less, her uneasiness that three weeks have passed, and we
have not had the comfort of seeing you. Do come up when
you can, with justice to yourself and other connections, for
it is a <em>great</em> comfort to me; something, I trust, I shall have
to show you. A note of warning from one who has been a
true but unheard prophet to my countrymen for five-and-twenty
years.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_187"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 187. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">January, 1821.</p>

<p>My dear young Friend,</p>

<p>The only impression left by you on my mind is an
increased desire to see you again, and at shorter intervals.
Were you my son by nature, I could not hold you dearer,
or more earnestly desire to retain you the adopted of whatever
within me will remain, when the dross and alloy of
infirmity shall have been purged away. I feel the most
entire confidence that no prosperous change of my outward
circumstances would add to your <em>faith</em> in the sincerity of
this assurance; still, however, the average of men being
what it is, and it being neither possible nor desirable to be
fully conscious in our understanding of the habits of thinking
and judging in the world around us, and yet to be
wholly impassive and unaffected by them in our feelings, it<a class="pagenum" id="Page_205" title="205"></a>
would endear and give a new value to an honourable competence,
that I should be able to evince the true nature and
degree of my esteem and attachment beyond the suspicion
even of the sordid, and separate from all that is accidental
or adventitious. But yet the friendship I feel for you is so
genial a warmth, and blends so undistinguishably with my
affections, is so perfectly one of the family in the household
of love, that I would not be otherwise than obliged to you;
and God is my witness, that my wish for an easier and less
embarrassed lot is <em>chiefly</em> (I think I might have said <em>exclusively</em>)
grounded on the deep conviction, that exposed to a
less bleak aspect I should bring forth flowers and fruits both
more abundant and more worthy of the unexampled kindness
of your <em>faith</em> in me. Interpreting the “wine” and the
“ivy garland” as figures of poetry signifying competence,
and the removal of the petty needs of the body that plug up
the pipes of the playing fountain (and such it is too well
known was the intent and meaning of the hardly used poet),
and oh! how often, when my heart has begun to swell from
the genial warmth of thought, as our northern lakes from
the (so called) bottom winds, when all above and around is
stillness and sunshine&mdash;how often have I repeated in my
own name the sweet stanza of Edmund Spenser:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Thou kenst not, Percie, how the rhyme should rage.</div>
    <div class="line">O! if my temples were bedewed with wine,</div>
    <div class="line">And girt in garlands of wild ivy twine;</div>
    <div class="line">How I could rear the muse on stately stage,</div>
    <div class="line">And teach her tread aloft in buskin fine</div>
    <div class="line">With queint Bellona in her equipage.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Read what follows as you would a note at the bottom of
a page.</p>

<p class="center">But ah! Mecænas is ywrapt in clay, and great Augustus long ago is dead.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_206" title="206"></a>(This is a natural sigh, and natural too is the reflection
that follows.)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">And if that any buds of poesy</div>
    <div class="line">Yet of the old stock ’gin to shoot again,</div>
    <div class="line">’Tis or <em>self</em>-lost the worldling’s meed to gain,</div>
    <div class="line">And with the rest to breathe its ribauldry,</div>
    <div class="line">Or as it sprung it wither must again;</div>
    <div class="line">Tom Piper makes them better melody.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But though natural, the complaint is not equally philosophical,
were it only on this account,&mdash;that I know of no age
in which the same has not been advanced, and with the
same grounds. Nay, I retract; there never was a time in
which the <em>complaint</em> would be so little wise, though perhaps
none in which the <em>fact</em> is more prominent. Neither philosophy
nor poetry ever did, nor as long as they are terms of
comparative excellence and contradistinction, ever can be
<em>popular</em>, nor honoured with the praise and favour of contemporaries.
But, on the other hand, there never was a time
in which either books, that were <em>held</em> for excellent as poetic
or philosophic, had so extensive and rapid a sale, or men
reputed poets and philosophers of a high rank were so much
<em>looked up</em> to in society, or so munificently, almost profusely
rewarded. Walter Scott’s poems and novels (except only
the two wretched abortions, <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and the <cite>Bride of
Ravensmuir</cite>, or whatever its name may be) supply both
instance and solution of the <em>present</em> conditions and components
of popularity, viz. to amuse without requiring any
effort of thought, and without exciting any deep emotion.
The age seems <em>sore</em> from excess of stimulation, just as, a
day or two after a thorough debauch and long sustained
drinking match, a man feels all over like a bruise. Even to
admire otherwise than <em>on the whole</em>, and where “I admire”
is but a synonym for “I remember I <em>liked</em> it very much
<em>when I was reading it</em>,” is too much an effort, would be too
disquieting an emotion. Compare <cite>Waverley</cite>, <cite>Guy Manner<a class="pagenum" id="Page_207" title="207"></a>ing</cite>,
and Co., with works that had an <em>immediate run</em> in the
last generation, <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>, <cite>Roderick Random</cite>, <cite>Sir
Charles Grandison</cite>, <cite>Clarissa Harlowe</cite>, and <cite>Tom Jones</cite> (all
of which became popular as soon as published, and therefore
instances fairly in point), and you will be convinced
that the difference of taste is real, and not any fancy or
croaking of my own.</p>

<p>But enough of these generals. It was my purpose to open
myself out to you in detail. My health, I have reason to
believe, is so intimately connected with the state of my
spirits, and these again so dependent on my thoughts, prospective
and retrospective, that I should not doubt the being
favoured with a sufficiency for my noblest undertaking, had
I the ease of heart requisite for the necessary abstraction of
the thoughts, and such a reprieve from the goading of the
immediate exigencies as might make tranquillity possible.
But, alas! I know by experience (and the knowledge is not
the less because the regret is not unmixed with self-blame,
and the consciousness of want of exertion and fortitude),
that my health will continue to decline, as long as the pain
from reviewing the barrenness of the past is great in an
inverse proportion to any rational anticipations of the future.
As I now am, however, from five to six hours devoted to
actual writing and composition in the day is the utmost that
my strength, not to speak of my nervous system, will permit;
and the invasions on this portion of my time from applications,
often of the most senseless kind, are such and so
many as to be almost as ludicrous even to myself as they
are vexatious. In less than a week I have not seldom received
half-a-dozen packets or parcels, of works printed or
manuscript, urgently requesting my candid <em>judgment</em>, or my
correcting hand. Add to these, letters from lords and ladies,
urging me to write reviews or puffs of heaven-born geniuses,
whose whole merit consists in being ploughmen or shoemakers.
Ditto from actors; entreaties for money, or recom<a class="pagenum" id="Page_208" title="208"></a>mendations
to publishers, from ushers out of place, etc. etc.;
and to <em>me</em>, who have neither interest, influence, nor money,
and, what is still more <em>àpropos</em>, can neither bring myself to
tell smooth falsehoods nor harsh truths, and, in the struggle,
too often do both in the anxiety to do neither.&mdash;I have
already the <em>written</em> materials and contents, requiring only
to be put together, from the loose papers and commonplace
or memorandum books, and needing no other change,
whether of omission, addition, or correction, than the mere
act of arranging, and the opportunity of seeing the whole
collectively bring with them of course,&mdash;I. Characteristics
of Shakspeare’s Dramatic Works, with a Critical Review of
each Play; together with a relative and comparative Critique
on the kind and degree of the Merits and Demerits of the
Dramatic Works of Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher,
and Massinger. The History of the English Drama; the
accidental advantages it afforded to Shakespeare, without in
the least detracting from the perfect originality or proper
creation of the Shakspearian Drama; the contradistinction
of the latter from the Greek Drama, and its still remaining
<em>uniqueness</em>, with the causes of this, from the combined influences
of Shakespeare himself, as man, poet, philosopher,
and finally, by conjunction of all these, dramatic poet; and
of the age, events, manners, and state of the English
language. This work, with every art of compression, amounts
to three volumes of about five hundred pages each.&mdash;II.
Philosophical Analysis of the Genius and Works of Dante,
Spenser, Milton, Cervantes, and Calderon, with similar, but
more compressed Criticisms on Chaucer, Ariosto, Donne,
Rabelais, and others, during the predominance of the
Romantic Poetry.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In one large volume.&mdash;These two works
will, I flatter myself, form a complete code of the principles
of judgment and feeling applied to Works of Taste; and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_209" title="209"></a>
not of <em>Poetry</em> only, but of Poesy in all its forms, Painting,
Statuary, Music, etc. etc.&mdash;III. The History of Philosophy
considered as a Tendency of the Human Mind to exhibit
the Powers of the Human Reason, to discover by its own
Strength the Origin and Laws of Man and the World from
Pythagoras to Locke and Condillac. Two volumes.&mdash;IV.
Letters on the Old and New Testament, and on the Doctrine
and Principles held in common by the Fathers and Founders
of the Reformation, addressed to a Candidate for Holy
Orders; including Advice on the Plan and Subjects of
Preaching, proper to a Minister of the Established Church.</p>

<p>To the completion of these four works I have literally
nothing more to do than <em>to transcribe</em>; but, as I before
hinted, from so many scraps and <em>Sibylline</em> leaves, including
margins of books and blank pages, that, unfortunately, I
must be my own scribe, and not done by myself, they will
be all but lost; or perhaps (as has been too often the case
already) furnish feathers for the caps of others; some for
this purpose, and some to plume the arrows of detraction,
to be let fly against the luckless bird from whom they had
been plucked or moulted.</p>

<p>In addition to these&mdash;of my <span class="smcap">great work</span>, to the preparation
of which more than twenty years of my life have been
devoted, and on which my hopes of extensive and permanent
utility, of fame, in the noblest<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> sense of the word, mainly
rest&mdash;that, by which I might,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Of this work, to which all my other writings (unless I except
my Poems, and these I can exclude in part only) are introductory
and preparative; and the result of which (if the
premises be, as I with the most tranquil assurance, am convinced
they are&mdash;insubvertible, the deductions legitimate,
and the conclusions commensurate, and only commensurate,
with both), must finally be a revolution of all that has been
called <em>Philosophy</em> or Metaphysics in England and France
since the era of the commencing predominance of the
mechanical system at the restoration of our second Charles,
and with this the present fashionable views, not only of
religion, morals, and politics, but even of the modern physics
and physiology. You will not blame the earnestness of my
expressions, nor the high importance which I attach to this
work; for how, with less noble objects, and less faith in
their attainment, could I stand acquitted of folly, and abuse<a class="pagenum" id="Page_211" title="211"></a>
of time, talents, and learning, in a labour of three-fourths of
my <em>intellectual</em> life? Of this work, something more than a
volume has been dictated by me, so as to exist fit for the
press, to my friend and enlightened pupil, Mr. Green; and
more than as much again would have been evolved and
delivered to paper, but that, for the last six or eight months,
I have been compelled to break off our weekly meeting,
from the necessity of writing (alas! alas! of <em>attempting</em> to
write) for purposes, and on the subjects of the passing day.&mdash;Of
my poetic works, I would fain finish the <cite>Christabel</cite>.
Alas! for the proud time when I planned, when I had
present to my mind, the materials, as well as the scheme, of
the Hymns entitled <cite>Spirit</cite>, <cite>Sun</cite>, <cite>Earth</cite>, <cite>Air</cite>, <cite>Water</cite>, <cite>Fire</cite>,
and <cite>Man</cite>: and the Epic Poem on&mdash;what still appears to me
the one only fit subject remaining for an Epic Poem&mdash;<cite>Jerusalem
besieged and destroyed by Titus</cite>.</p>

<p>And here comes, my dear friend&mdash;here comes my sorrow
and my weakness, my grievance and my confession. Anxious
to perform the duties of the day arising out of the wants of
the day, these wants, too, presenting themselves in the most
painful of all forms,&mdash;that of a debt owing to those who
will not exact it, and yet need its payment, and the delay,
the long (not live-long but <em>death</em>-long) behind-hand of my
accounts to friends, whose utmost care and frugality on the
one side, and industry on the other, the wife’s management
and the husband’s assiduity are put in requisition to make
both ends meet, I am at once forbidden to attempt, and too
perplexed earnestly to pursue, the <em>accomplishment</em> of the
works worthy of me, those I mean above enumerated,&mdash;even
if, savagely as I have been injured by one of the two influensive
Reviews, and with more effective enmity undermined
by the utter silence or occasional detractive compliments
of the other,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> I had the probable chance of disposing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_212" title="212"></a>
of them to the booksellers, so as even to liquidate my mere
boarding accounts during the time expended in the transcription,
arrangement, and proof correction. And yet, on
the other hand, my heart and mind are for ever recurring to
them. Yes, my conscience forces me to plead guilty, I have
only by fits and starts even prayed. I have not prevailed on
myself to pray to God in sincerity and entireness for the
fortitude that might enable me to resign myself to the abandonment
of all my life’s best hopes, to say boldly to myself,&mdash;“Gifted
with powers confessedly above mediocrity, aided
by an education, of which, no less from almost unexampled
hardships and sufferings than from manifold and peculiar
advantages, I have never yet found a parallel, I have devoted
myself to a life of unintermitted reading, thinking, meditating,
and observing. I have not only sacrificed all worldly
prospects of wealth and advancement, but have in my inmost
soul stood aloof from temporary reputation. In consequence
of these toils and this self-dedication, I possess a calm and
clear consciousness, that in many and most important departments
of truth and beauty I have outstrode my contemporaries&mdash;those
at least of highest name; that the number
of my printed works bears witness that I have not been
idle, and the seldom acknowledged, but strictly <em>proveable</em>,
effects of my labours appropriated to the immediate welfare
of my age in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> before and during the peace
of Amiens, in <cite>The Courier</cite> afterwards, and in the series and
various subjects of my lectures at Bristol and at the Royal
and Surrey Institutions, in Fetter Lane, at Willis’s Rooms,
and at the Crown and Anchor (add to which the unlimited
freedom of my communications in colloquial life), may surely
be allowed as evidence that I have not been useless in my
generation. But, from circumstances, the <em>main</em> portion of
my harvest is still on the ground, ripe indeed, and only<a class="pagenum" id="Page_213" title="213"></a>
waiting, a few for the sickle, but a large part only for the
<em>sheaving</em>, and carting, and housing; but from all this I must
turn away, must let them rot as they lie, and be as though
they never had been, for I must go and gather blackberries
and earth-nuts, or pick mushrooms and gild oak-apples for
the palates and fancies of chance customers. I must abrogate
the name of philosopher and poet, and scribble as fast
as I can, and with as little thought as I can, for <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite>, or as I have been employed for the last days, in
writing MS. sermons for lazy clergymen, who stipulate that
the composition must not be more than respectable, for fear
they should be desired to publish the visitation sermon!”
This I have not yet had courage to do. My soul sickens
and my heart sinks; and thus, oscillating between both, I
do neither, neither as it ought to be done, or to any profitable
end. If I were to detail only the various, I might say
capricious, interruptions that have prevented the finishing of
this very scrawl, begun on the very day I received your last
kind letter, you would need no other illustrations.</p>

<p>Now I see but one possible plan of rescuing my permanent
utility. It is briefly this and plainly. For what we
struggle with inwardly, we find at least easiest to <em>bolt out</em>
namely&mdash;that of engaging from the circle of those who think
respectfully and hope highly of my powers and attainments
a yearly sum, for three or four years, adequate to my actual
support, with such comforts and decencies of appearance as
my health and habits have made necessaries, so that my
mind may be unanxious as far as the present time is concerned;
that thus I should stand both enabled and pledged
to begin with some one work of these above mentioned,
and for two-thirds of my whole time to devote myself to this
exclusively till finished, to take the chance of its success by
the best mode of publication that would involve me in no
risk, then to proceed with the next, and so on till the works
above mentioned as already in full material existence should<a class="pagenum" id="Page_214" title="214"></a>
be reduced into formal and actual being; while in the remaining
third of my time I might go on maturing and completing
my great work, and (for if but easy in mind, I have
no doubt either of the re-awakening power or of the kindling
inclination), and my <cite>Christabel</cite>, and what else the happier
hour might inspire&mdash;and without inspiration a barrel-organ
may be played right deftly; but</p>

<p>Now Mr. Green has offered to contribute from £30 to
£40 yearly, for three or four years; my young friend and
pupil, the son of one of my dearest old friends, £50; and I
think that from £10 to £20 I could rely upon from another.
The sum required would be about £200, to be repaid, of
course, should the disposal or sale, and as far as the disposal
and sale, of my writings produce the means.</p>

<p>I have thus placed before you at large, wanderingly, as
well as diffusely, the statement which I am inclined to send
in a compressed form to a few of those of whose kind dispositions
towards me I have received assurances,&mdash;and to
their interest and influence I must leave it&mdash;anxious, however,
before I do this, to learn from you your very, very
inmost feeling and judgment as to the previous questions.
Am I entitled, have I earned <em>a right</em> to do this? Can I do
it without moral degradation? and, lastly, can it be done
without loss of character in the eyes of my acquaintance,
and of my friends’ acquaintance, who may have been informed
of the circumstances? That, if attempted at all, it
will be attempted in such a way, and that such persons only<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" title="215"></a>
will be spoken to, as will not expose me to indelicate rebuffs
to be afterwards matter of gossip, I know those, to whom I
shall entrust the statement, too well to be much alarmed
about.</p>

<p>Pray let me either see or hear from you as soon as possible;
for, indeed and indeed, it is no inconsiderable accession
to the pleasure I anticipate from disembarrassment, that
<em>you</em> would have to contemplate in a more gracious form,
and in a more ebullient play of the inward fountain, the
mind and manners of,</p>

<p>Coleridge’s animadversions on Scott’s work are not justifiable.
Although Sir Walter’s poetry is not to be compared
for literary technique to that of Coleridge, it has a merit not
unlike some parts of Coleridge’s own. Sir Walter may be
designated the Poet of Romantic Association; much of his
poetry is founded on the associations of localities celebrated
in history. The <cite>Second Part of Christabel</cite> and the <cite>Knight’s
Tomb</cite> are clearly of this genre of poetry. A touch of jealousy
of the success of Scott seems to enter into Coleridge’s estimate
of his brother poet. His criticism of the novels is of
less importance; for Coleridge was always hostile to the
novel as enticing men away from serious study and reading.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">HENRY CRABB ROBINSON</span></h2>

<p>[Among the men who met Coleridge, and recorded
their impressions of his talk, Henry Crabb Robinson
occupies a prominent place. He was one of the leading
genius tasters of the time, and made pilgrimages to great
living men in place of visiting the relics of departed worth
or the shrines of the saints, which serves with others the
same purpose. He thus came into contact with as wide a
circle of intellectuality as any man of his day, his list including
Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, and many of the Germans,
Madame De Staël, Wordsworth, Lamb, and a host of others
well known to readers of his lively <cite>Diary</cite>. Henry Crabb
Robinson met Coleridge for the first time in 1810 at Lamb’s,
and was at once smitten with Coleridge’s talk. He met him
several times in the first month of their acquaintanceship,
and one of his entries in the <cite>Diary</cite> reads&mdash;“Coleridge kept
me on the stretch of attention and admiration from half
past three to twelve o’clock.” But for a long time Robinson
did not rank Coleridge as high as Wordsworth, with whom
he had been familiar before meeting the former, and he was
rather surprised when Lamb put Coleridge above the poet
of Rydal (<cite>Diary</cite>, i, 319).</p>

<p>Robinson frequently visited Coleridge at Highgate. Indeed
he was among the first of Coleridge’s acquaintances to
be asked to dine at the Grove. On 17th June 1817 we find
Coleridge asking him to make an appointment so that he
might bring Ludwig Tieck with him to meet John Hook<a class="pagenum" id="Page_217" title="217"></a>ham
Frere (<cite>Letters</cite>, 671). He induces him to come to
Highgate to have a walk or drive “in Caen Wood and its
delicious groves and alleys (the finest in England), a grand
Cathedral aisle of giant lime-trees, Pope’s favourite composition
walk when with the old Earl, a brother rogue of yours
in the law line.” He informs Robinson that he has read
two pages of <cite>Lallah Rookh</cite>, which he pronounces “Crockery-ware!”</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of the many entries in the
<cite>Diary</cite>&mdash;“December 24, 1822. This afternoon I spent at
Aders.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> A large party&mdash;a splendid dinner, prepared by a
French cook; and music in the evening. Coleridge was the
star of the evening. He talked in his usual way, though with
more liberality than when I saw him last some years ago.
But he was somewhat less animated and brilliant and paradoxical.
The music was enjoyed by Coleridge, but I could
have dispensed with it for the sake of his conversation”
(<cite>Diary</cite>, ii, 239).</p>

<p>The letters of Coleridge to Robinson preserved in the
<cite>Diary</cite>, are as follows: I, May 1808 (ii, 266&ndash;7); II, 1811
(ii, 360&ndash;4); III, 7th Dec. 1812 (iii, 423&ndash;4); IV, June 1817
(iii, 57&ndash;8); V, 3rd May 1818 (iii, 93&ndash;95). The letters to
Robinson in Brandl’s <cite>Life</cite> are&mdash;p. 322 (1811); p. 323, 18th
Nov. 1811; p. 354, 3rd December 1817; p. 362, 20th June

<p>[Charles Lamb, Coleridge’s associate of the “Cat
and Salutation” days, remained a close friend to the
last, and he plays an important part in the Highgate period.
Among Lamb’s letters, edited by Canon Ainger, are sixty-two
to Coleridge; and there are a few to Allsop and James
Gillman from 1821 onward. The next fourteen letters to
Allsop reflect the relationship of the little circle of the
Lambs and Gillman and Coleridge.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>God bless you, and all who are dear and near to
you! but as to your pens, they seem to have been plucked
from the <em>devil’s</em> pinions, and slit and shaped by the blunt
edge of the broad sprays of his antlers. Of the ink (<em>i.e.</em> your
inkstand), it would be base to complain. I hate abusing
folks in their <em>absence</em>. Do you know, my dear friend, that
having sundry little snug superstitions of my own, I shrewdly
suspect that whimsical ware of that sort is connected with
the state and garniture of your paper-staining machinery.&mdash;Is
it so? Well, I have seen Murray, and he has been civil, I
may say kind, in his manners. Is this your knock?&mdash;Is it
you on the stairs?&mdash;No. I explained my full purpose to him,
namely,&mdash;that he should take me and my concerns, past<a class="pagenum" id="Page_219" title="219"></a>
and future, for print and reprint, under his umbrageous
foliage, though the original name of his great predecessor in
the patronage of genius, who gave the name of Augustan to
all happy epochs&mdash;Octavius would be more appropriate&mdash;and
he promises,&mdash;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">cætera desunt</em>.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gillman’s kind love, and we beg that
the good lady’s late remembering that (as often the very
fullness and vividness of the purpose and intention to do a
thing imposes on the mind a sort of counterfeit feeling of
quiet, similar to the satisfaction which the having done it
would produce) you had not been written to, will not prejudice
the present attempt at “better late than never.” We
have a party <em>to-morrow</em>, in which, because we believed it
would interest you, you stood included. In addition to a
neighbour Robert Sutton, and ourselves, and Mrs. Gillman’s
most un-Mrs. Gillmanly sister (but <em>n. b.</em> this is a
secret to all who are both blind and deaf), there will be the
Mathews (Mr. and Mrs.) <em>at home</em>, Mathews I mean, and
Charles and Mary Lamb.</p>

<p>Of myself the best thing that I can say is that, in the belief
of those well qualified to judge, I am not so ill as I fancy
myself. Be this as it may,</p>

<p>“Of this day and the one following,” Allsop says, “I have
a few notes, which appear to me of interest. It must be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_220" title="220"></a>
borne constantly in mind, that much of what is preserved
has relation to positions enforced by others, which Coleridge
held to be untenable on the particular grounds urged, not
as being untrue in themselves.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Had Lord Byron possessed perseverance enough to
undergo the drudgery of research, and had his theological
studies and attainments been at all like mine, he would
have been able to unsettle all the evidences of Christianity,
upheld as it is at present by simple confutation. Is it
possible to assent to the doctrine of redemption as at present
promulgated, that the moral death of an <em>unoffending</em>
being should be a consequence of the transgression of
humanity<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> <em>and its atonement</em>?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Walter Scott’s novels are chargeable with the same faults
as Bertram, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">et id omne genus</em>, viz., that of ministering to the
depraved appetite for excitement, and, though in a far less
degree, creating sympathy for the vicious and infamous,
solely because the fiend is <em>daring</em>. Not twenty lines of
Scott’s poetry will ever reach posterity; it has relation to
nothing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I wrote a letter upon the scarcity, it was generally
said that it was the production of an immense cornfactor,
and a letter was addressed to me under that persuasion,
beginning “Crafty Monopolist.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is very singular that no <em>true poet</em> should have arisen
from the lower classes, when it is considered that every<a class="pagenum" id="Page_221" title="221"></a>
peasant who can read knows more of books now than did
Æschylus, Sophocles, or Homer; yet if we except Burns,
none<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> such have been.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Crashaw seems in his poems to have given the first
ebullience of his imagination, unshapen into form, or much
of, what we now term, sweetness. In the poem, <cite>Hope</cite>, by
way of question and answer, his superiority to Cowley is
self-evident. In that on the name of Jesus equally so; but
his lines on St. Theresa are the finest.</p>

<p>Where he does combine richness of thought and diction
nothing can excel, as in the lines you so much admire&mdash;</p>

<p>These verses were ever present to my mind whilst<a class="pagenum" id="Page_222" title="222"></a>
writing the second part of <cite>Christabel</cite>; if, indeed, by some
subtle process of the mind they did not suggest the first
thought of the whole poem.&mdash;Poetry, as regards small poets,
may be said to be, in a certain sense, conventional in its
accidents and in its illustrations; thus Crashaw uses an
image:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">As sugar melts in tea away,</p>

<p>which, although <em>proper then</em>, and <em>true now</em>, was in bad taste
at that time equally with the present. In Shakspeare, in
Chaucer there was nothing of this.</p>

<p>The wonderful faculty which Shakspeare above all other
men possessed, or rather the power which possessed him in
the highest degree, of anticipating everything, evidently is
the result&mdash;at least partakes&mdash;of meditation, or that mental
process which consists in the submitting to the operation of
thought every object of feeling, or impulse, or passion
observed <em>out</em> of it. I would be willing to live only as long
as Shakspeare were the mirror to nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What can be finer in any poet than that beautiful passage
in Milton&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent4">&mdash;&mdash;Onward he moved</div>
    <div class="line">And thousands of his saints around.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is grandeur, but it is grandeur without completeness:
but he adds&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Far off their coming shone;</p>

<p>which is the highest sublime. There is <em>total</em> completeness.</p>

<p>So I would say that the Saviour praying on the Mountain,
the Desert on one hand, the Sea on the other, the city
at an immense distance below, was sublime. But I should
say of the Saviour looking towards the City, his countenance
full of pity, that he was majestic, and of the situation that
it was grand.</p>

<p>When the whole and the parts are seen at once, as<a class="pagenum" id="Page_223" title="223"></a>
mutually producing and explaining each other, as unity in
multiety, there results shapeliness&mdash;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma formosa</em>. Where
the perfection of <em>form</em> is combined with pleasurableness in
the sensations, excited by the matters or substances so
formed, there results the Beautiful.</p>

<p><em>Corollary.</em>&mdash;Hence colour is eminently subservient to
beauty, because it is susceptible of forms, <em>i.e.</em> outline, and
yet is a sensation. But a rich mass of scarlet clouds, seen
without any attention to the <em>form</em> of the mass or of the
parts, may be a <em>delightful</em> but not a beautiful object or
colour.</p>

<p>When there is a deficiency of unity in the line forming
the whole (as angularity, for instance), and of number in
the plurality or the parts, there arises the Formal.</p>

<p>When the parts are numerous, and impressive, and predominate,
so as to prevent or greatly lessen the attention to
the whole, there results the Grand.</p>

<p>Where the impression of the whole, <em>i.e.</em> the sense of
unity predominates, so as to abstract the mind from the
parts&mdash;the Majestic.</p>

<p>Where the parts by their harmony produce an effect of
a whole, but there is no seen form of a whole producing or
explaining the parts, <em>i.e.</em> when the parts only are seen and
distinguished, but the whole is felt&mdash;the Picturesque.</p>

<p>Where neither whole nor parts, but unity, as boundless
or endless <em>allness</em>&mdash;the Sublime.</p>

<p>It often amuses me to hear men impute all their misfortunes
to fate, luck, or destiny, whilst their successes or
good fortune they ascribe to their own sagacity, cleverness,
or penetration. It never occurs to such minds that light
and darkness are one and the same, emanating from, and
being part of, the same nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_224" title="224"></a></p>

<p>The word Nature, from its extreme familiarity, and in
some instances, fitness, as well as from the want of a term,
or <em>other</em> name for God, has caused very much confusion in
the thoughts and language of men. Hence a Nature-God,
or God-Nature, not God in Nature; just as others, with as
little reason, have constructed a natural and sole religion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Is it then true, that Reason to man is the ultimate
faculty, and that, to convince a <em>reasonable</em> man, it is sufficient
to adduce adequate reasons or arguments? How, if
this be so, does it happen that we reject as insufficient the
<em>reasoning</em> of a friend in our affliction for this or that <em>cause
or reason</em>, yet are comforted, soothed, and reassured, by
similar or far less sufficient <em>reasons</em>, when urged by a
friendly and affectionate woman? It is no answer to say
that women were made <em>comforters</em>; that it is the tone, and,
in the instance of man’s chief, best comforter, the wife of
his youth, the mother of his children, the oneness with
himself, which gives value to the consolation; the <em>reasons</em>
are the same, whether urged by man, woman, or child. It
must be, therefore, that there is something in the will itself,
above and beyond, if not higher than, reason. Besides, is
Reason or the reasoning always the same, even when free
from passion, film, or fever? I speak of the same person.
Does he hold the doctrine of temperance in equal reverence
when hungry as after he is sated? Does he at forty retain
the same <em>reason</em>, only extended and developed, as he possessed
at four and twenty? Does he not love the meat in
his youth which he cannot endure in his old age? But
these are appetites, and therefore no part of him. Is not a
man one to-day and another to-morrow? Do not the very
ablest and wisest of men attach greater weight at one
moment to an argument or a <em>reason</em> than they do at
another? Is this a want of sound and stable judgment?<a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" title="225"></a>
If so, what then is this perfect reason? for we have shown
what it is not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is prettily feigned, that when Plutus is sent from
Jupiter, he limps and gets on very slowly at first; but when
he comes from Pluto, he runs and is swift of foot. This,
rightly taken, is a great sweetener of slow gains. Bacon
(alas! the day) seems to have had this in mind when he
says, “seek not proud gains, but such as thou mayst get
justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and leave contentedly.”
He that is covetous makes too much haste; and
the wise man saith of him, “he cannot be innocent.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have often been pained by observing in others, and was
fully conscious in myself, of a <em>sympathy</em> with those of rank
and condition in preference to their inferiors, and never
discovered the source of this sympathy until one day at
Keswick I heard a thatcher’s wife crying her heart out for
the death of her little child. It was given me all at once
to feel, that I sympathized equally with the poor and the
rich in all that related to the best part of humanity&mdash;the
affections; but that, in what relates to fortune, to <em>mental</em>
misery, struggles, and conflicts, we reserve consolation and
sympathy for those who can appreciate its force and value.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are many men, especially at the outset of life,
who, in their too eager desire for the end, overlook the
difficulties in the way; there is another class, who see
nothing else. The first class <em>may</em> sometimes fail; the latter
rarely succeed.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>Be assured that nothing bearing a nearer resemblance
to offence, whether felt or perceived, than a syllogism bears
to the colour of the man in the moon’s whiskers, ever
crossed my brain: not even with that brisk diagonal traverse
which Ghosts and apparitions always choose to surprise us in.
I have <em>indeed</em> observed <em>or</em> fancied, that, for some time past,
you have been anxious about something, have had something
pressing upon your mind, which I wished <em>out of you</em>,
though not particularly <em>to have</em> it out of you. I must explain
myself. Say that X. were my dearest Friend, to whom I
would be as it were transparent, and have him so to me in
all respects that concerned our permanent Being, and likewise
in all circumstantial accidents in which we could be of
service to each other. Yet there are many things that will
press upon us which are our <em>individualities</em>, which one man
does not feel any tendency in himself to speak of to a man,
however dear or valued. X. does not think or wish to think
of it when with Y., nor Y. in his turn when with X., and yet
still the great law holds good&mdash;whatever vexes or depresses
ought if possible to be <em>out</em> of us. Now I say that I should
rejoice if you had a female Friend&mdash;a Sister, an Aunt, or a
Beloved to whom you could lay yourself open. I should
further exult if your <em>confidante</em> were <em>my</em> Friend too, my
Sister or my Wife.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>We are quite sure that you would not allow yourself
to fancy any rightful ground, cause, or occasion for not
coming here, but the wish, the duty, or the propriety of
going elsewhere or staying at home. When the Needle of
your Thoughts begins to be magnetic, you may be certain
that my <em>Pole</em> is at that moment attracting you by the spiritual
magic of strong wishing for your arrival. N.B. My <em>Pole</em>

<p>But seriously&mdash;I am a little anxious&mdash;so give my blest
sisterly Friend a few lines by return of post&mdash;just to let us
know that you are and have been well, and that nothing of

<p class="dateline">Sept. 15th, 1821.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>I cannot rest until I have answered your last letter.
I have contemplated your character, affectionately indeed,
but through a clear medium. No film of passion, no glittering
mist of outward advantages, has arisen between the sight
and the object: I had no other prepossession than the
esteem which my knowledge of your sentiments and conduct
could not but secure for you. I soon learnt to esteem
you; and in esteeming, became attached to you. I began by<a class="pagenum" id="Page_228" title="228"></a>
loving the man on account of his conduct, but I ended in
valuing the actions chiefly as so many looks and attitudes
of the same person. “<em>Hast</em> thou any thing? Share it with
me, and I will pay thee an equivalent. <em>Art</em> thou any thing?
O then we will exchange souls.”</p>

<p>We can none of us, not the wisest of us, brood over any
source of affliction inwardly, keeping it back, and as it were
pressing it in on ourselves; but we must <span class="smcap">magnify</span> it. We
cannot see it clearly, much less distinctly; and as the object
enlarges beyond its real proportions, so it becomes vivid;
and the feelings that blend with it assume a proportionate
undue intensity. So the one acts on the other, and what at
first was effect, in its turn becomes a cause; and when
at length we have taken heart, and given the whole thing,
with all its several parts, the proper distance from our mind’s
eye, by confiding it to a true friend, we are ourselves surprised
to find what a dwarf the giant shrinks into, as soon as
it steps out of the mist into clear sunlight.</p>

<p>I am aware that these are truths of which you do not need
to be informed; but they will not be the less impressive on
this account in your judgment, knowing, as you must know,
that nothing short of my deep and anxious convictions of
their importance in all cases of hidden distress, and of their
<em>unspeakable</em> importance in yours, could impel me to <em>seek</em>
and <em>entreat</em> your <em>entire</em> confidence, to beg you, so fervently
as I here am doing, to open out to me the cause of your
anxiety, that I may offer you the best advice in my power,&mdash;advice
that will not be the less dispassionate from its being
dictated by zealous friendship, and blended with the truest
love.</p>

<p>I fear that in any decision to which you may come in any
matter affecting yourself alone, you may, from a culpable
delicacy of honour, which, forbidden by wisdom and the
universal experience of others, cannot but be in contradiction
to the genuine dictates of duty, want fortitude to choose,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_229" title="229"></a>
the lesser evil, at whatever cost to your immediate feelings,
and to put that choice into immediate and peremptory act.
But I must finish. I trust that the warmth and earnestness
of my language are not warranted by the occasion; but
they are barely proportionate to the present solicitude of,</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_193"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 193. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Sept. 24th, 1821.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I will begin with the beginning of your (to me most
affecting) letter. Not exactly <em>obligation</em>, my entirely beloved
and relied-on friend! The soiling hand of the world has
dyed and sunk into the sense and import of the term too inseparably,
for it to convey the kind and degree of what I feel
towards you, on the one scale. I love you so truly, that in
the first glance, as it were, and <em>welcome</em> of your anxious affection,
it delights me for the very act’s sake. I think only of
it and you, or rather both are one and the same, and I live
in you. Nor does the complacency suffer any abatement,
but becomes more intense and lively. As a mother would
talk of the soothing attentions, the sacrifices and devotion
of a son, eager to supply every want and anticipate every
wish, so I talk to myself concerning you; and I am proud of
you, and proud to be the object of what cannot but appear
lovely to my judgment, and which the hard contrast in so
many heart-withering instances forced on me by the experience
of my last twenty years, compels me to feel and value
with an additional glow. Lastly, it is a source of strength
and comfort to know that the labours and aspirations and
sympathies of the genuine and invisible Humanity exist in a
social world of their own; that its attractions and assimila<a class="pagenum" id="Page_230" title="230"></a>tions
are no Platonic fable, no dancing flames or luminous
bubbles on the magic cauldron of my wishes; but that there
are, even in this unkind life, spiritual parentages and filiations
of the soul. Can there be a counterpoise to these? Not a
counterpoise&mdash;but as weights in the counter-scale there will
come the self-reproach, that spite of all inauspicious obstacles,
not in my power to remove without loss of self-respect,
I have not done all I could and might have done to
prevent my present state of dependence. I am now able to
hope that I shall be capable of setting apart such a portion
of my <em>useable</em> time to my greater work (in assertion of the
ideal truths and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</em> probability, and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">à posteriori</em> internal
and external evidence of the historic truth of the
Christian religion), as to leave a sufficient portion for a not
unprofitable series of articles for pecuniary supply. I entertain
some hope, too, that my <cite>Logic</cite>, which I could begin
printing immediately if I could find a publisher willing to
undertake it on equitable terms, might prove an exception
to the general fate of my publications. It is a long lane that
has no turning, and while my own heart bears witness to
the genial delight you would feel in assisting me, I know
that you would have a more satisfactory gladness in my not
needing it.</p>

<p>And now a few, a very few, words on the latter portion of
your letter. You know, my dearest Friend, how I acted myself,
and that my example cannot be urged in confirmation
of my judgment. I certainly strive hard to divest my mind
of every prejudice, to look at the question sternly through
the principle of Right separated from all mere Expedience,
nay, from the question of earthly happiness <em>for its own sake</em>.
But I cannot answer to myself that the image of any serious
obstacle to your peace of heart, that the Thought of your
full development of soul being put a stop to, of a secret
anxiety blighting your <em>utility</em> by cankering your happiness,
I cannot be sure&mdash;I cannot be sure that this may not have<a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" title="231"></a>
made me <em>weigh</em> with a trembling and unsteady hand, and
less than half the presumption of error, afforded by the
shrinking and recoil of your moral sense or even feeling,
would render it my duty and my impulse to bring my conclusion
anew to the ordeal of my Reason and Conscience.
But on your side, my dear Friend! try with me to contemplate
the question as a problem in the <em>science</em> of Morals, in
the first instance, and to recollect that there are false or intrusive
weights possible in the other scale; that our very
virtues may become, or be transformed into temptations to,
or occasions of, <em>partial</em> judgment; that we may judge partially
<em>against</em> ourselves from the very fear, perhaps contempt,
of the contrary; that self may be moodily gratified by <em>self</em>-sacrifice,
and that the Heart itself, in its perplexity, may
acquiesce for a time in the decision as a more safe way;
and, lastly, that the question can only be fully answered,
when Self and Neighbour, as equi-distant <img src="images/triangle3.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle" /> from the
conscience or God, are blended in the common term, a
<em>Human Being</em>: that we are <em>commanded</em> to love ourselves as
our Neighbour in the Law that requires a Christian to love
his Neighbour as himself.</p>

<p>But indeed I persuade myself that this dissonance is not
real between us, and that it would not have seemed to exist,
had I continued the subject into the possible particular
cases; <em>e.g.</em>, suppose a case in which the misery, and so far
the moral incapacitation, of both parties were certainly foreseen
as the immediate consequence. A morality of Consequences
I, you well know, reprobate; but to exclude the
necessary <em>effect</em> of an action is to take away all meaning from
the word action&mdash;<em>to strike Duty with blindness</em>. I repeat it,
that I do not, cannot find it in myself to believe, that <em>on any
one</em> case, made out in all its limbs, features, and circumstances,
your heart and mine would prompt different
verdicts.</p>

<p>But the thought of you personally and individually is at<a class="pagenum" id="Page_232" title="232"></a>
present too strong and stirring to permit me to reason on any
points. If the weather is at all plausible, we propose to set
off on Saturday. I do most earnestly wish that you could
accompany us; a steam-vessel would give us three-fourths of
the whole day to <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</em> conversation. God bless you,</p>

<p>Cottle saw Coleridge for the last time in 1821. He says
“It is a consolation to reflect, that, in the year 1821, being
in London, I called to see Mr. Coleridge, at Mr. Gillman’s,
when he welcomed me in his former kind and cordial manner.
The depressing thought filled my mind, that that would
be our final interview in this world, as it was. On my going
away, Mr. C. presented me with his <cite>Statesman’s Manual</cite>, in
the title-page of which he wrote&mdash;‘Joseph Cottle, from his
old and affectionate friend, S. T. Coleridge.’”&mdash;(<cite>Early
Recollections</cite>, ii, 177.)</p>

<p>Coleridge, during his Highgate period, was induced by
Blackwood to send a few contributions to his magazine (see
<cite>Lamb’s Letters</cite>, ii, 32). He had contributed <cite>Fancy in
Nubibus</cite> in 1819, and he now sent selections from his
<cite>Literary Correspondence</cite> in the shape of letters, which
appeared in 1821. Two of these letters are printed by
Thomas Ashe (<cite>Miscell. Works</cite>, 238). The following is one of
the letters not published by Ashe:</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_194"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 194. To William Blackwood</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">October, 1821.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Here have I been sitting, this whole long-lagging,
<em>muzzy</em>, mizly morning, struggling without success against
the insuperable disgust I feel to the task of explaining the
abrupt chasm at the outset of our correspondence, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" title="233"></a>
disposed to let your verdict take its course, rather than
suffer over again by detailing the causes of the stoppage;
though sure by so doing to acquit <em>my will</em> of all share in
the result. Instead of myself, and of <em>you</em>, my dear sir, in
relation to myself, I have been thinking, first, of the <cite>Edinburgh
Magazine</cite>; then of magazines generally and comparatively;
then of a magazine in the abstract; and lastly,
of the immense importance and yet strange neglect of that
prime dictate of prudence and common sense&mdash;Distinct
Means to Distinct Ends. But here I must put in one
proviso, not in any relation though to the aphorism itself,
which is of universal validity, but relatively to my intended
application of it. I must assume&mdash;I mean, that the individuals
disposed to grant me free access and fair audience
for my remarks, have <em>a conscience</em>&mdash;such a portion at least,
as being eked out with superstition and sense of character,
will suffice to prevent them from seeking to realise the
<em>ultimate</em> end, (<em>i.e.</em> the maxim of profit) by base or disreputable
means. This, therefore, may be left out of the
present argument, an extensive sale being the common
object of all publishers, of whatever kind the publications
may be, morally considered. Nor do the means appropriate
to this end differ. Be the work good or evil in its tendency,
in both cases alike there is one question to be predetermined,
viz. what class or classes of the reading-world the
work is intended for? I made the proviso, however, because
I would not mislead any man even for an honest cause, and
my experience will not allow me to promise an equal
immediate circulation from a work addressed to the higher
interests and blameless predilections of men, as from one
constructed on the plan of flattering the envy and vanity of
sciolism, and gratifying the cravings of vulgar curiosity. Such
may be, and in some instances, I doubt not, has been, the
result. But I dare not answer for it beforehand, even
though both works should be equally well suited to their<a class="pagenum" id="Page_234" title="234"></a>
several purposes, which will not be thought a probable case,
when it is considered how much less talent, and of how
much commoner a kind, is required in the latter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, however, I am persuaded that a
sufficient success, and less liable to drawbacks from competition,
would not fail to attend a work on the former plan,
if the scheme and execution of the contents were as appropriate
to the object which the purchasers must be supposed to
have in view as the means adopted for its outward attraction,
and its general circulation were to the interest of its proprietors.</p>

<p>During a long literary life, I have been no inattentive
observer of periodical publications; and I can remember
no failure in any work deserving success that might not
have been anticipated from some error or deficiency in the
means, either in regard to the mode of circulating the
work (as, for instance, by the vain attempt to unite the
characters of author, editor, and publisher), or to the typographical
appearance; or else from its want of suitableness
to the class of readers on whom, it should have been foreseen,
the remunerating sale must principally depend. It
would be misanthropy to suppose that the seekers after
truth, information, and innocent amusement, are not sufficiently
numerous to support a work in which these attractions
are prominent, without the dishonest aid of personality,
literary faction, or treacherous invasions of the sacred
recesses of private life, without slanders which both reason
and duty command us to <em>disbelieve</em> as well as to abhor;
for what but falsehood, or that half truth, which is falsehood
in its most malignant form, can or ought to be
expected from a self-convicted traitor and ingrate?</p>

<p>If these remarks are well founded, we may narrow the
problem to the few following terms&mdash;it being understood
that the work now in question is a monthly publication, not
devoted to any <em>one</em> branch of knowledge or literature, but a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_235" title="235"></a>
magazine of whatever may be supposed to interest readers
in general, not excluding the discoveries or even the speculations
of science, that are generally intelligible or interesting,
so that the portion devoted to any one subject or
department shall be kept proportionate to the number of
readers for whom it may be supposed to have a <em>particular</em>
interest. Here, however, we must not forget, that however
few the actual dilettanti, or men of the fancy may be, yet,
as long as the articles remain generally intelligible (in
<em>pugilism</em>, for instance) Variety and Novelty communicate
an attraction that interests all. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sum, nihil humani a
me alienum.</em> If to this we add the exclusion of theological
controversy, which is endless, I shall have pretty accurately
described the present <cite>Edinburgh Magazine</cite>, as to its characteristic
plan and purposes; which may, I think, be comprised
in three terms, as Philosophical. Philological, and
Aesthetic Miscellany. The word miscellany, however, must
be taken as involving a predicate in itself, in addition to
the three preceding epithets, comprehending, namely, all
the ephemeral births of intellectual life which add to the
gaiety and variety of the work, without interfering with its
express and regular objects.</p>

<p>Having thus a sufficiently definite notion of what your
Magazine is, and is intended to be, I propose to myself, as
a problem to find out, <em>in detail</em>, what the <em>means</em> would be to
the most perfect attainment of this end. In other words,
what the <em>scheme</em>, and of what nature, and in what order and
proportion, the <em>contents</em> should be of a monthly publication;
in order for it to verify the title of a Philosophical, Philological,
and Aesthetic Miscellany and Magazine. The
result of my lucubrations I hope to forward in my next,
under the title of <cite>The Ideal of a Magazine</cite>; and to mark
those departments, in the filling up of which, I flatter
myself with the prospect of being a fellow labourer. But
since I began this scrawl, a friend reminded me of a letter I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_236" title="236"></a>
wrote him many years ago, on the improvement of the mind
by the habit of commencing our inquiries with the attempt
to construct the most absolute or perfect form of the object
desiderated, leaving its practicability, in the first instance,
undetermined. An essay, in short, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">de emendatione intellectûs
per ideas</em>&mdash;the beneficial influence of which on his mind he
spoke of with warmth. The main contents of the letter, the
effect of which my friend appreciated so highly, were
derived from conversation with a great man now no more.
And as I have reason to regard that conversation as an
epoch in the history of my own mind, I feel myself encouraged
to hope that its publication may not prove useless
to some of your numerous readers, to whom Nature has
given the stream, and nothing is wanting but to be led into
the right channel. There is one other motive to which I
must plead conscious, not only in the following, but in all
these, my preliminary contributions; viz.&mdash;That by the
reader’s agreement with the principles and sympathy with
the general feelings which they are meant to impress, the
interest of my future contributions, and still more, their
permanent effect, will be heightened; and most so in those
in which, as narrative and imaginative compositions, there
is the least show of reflection, on my part, and the least
necessity for it,&mdash;though I flatter myself not the least
opportunity on the part of my readers.</p>

<p>It will be better, too, if I mistake not, both for your
purposes and mine, to have it said hereafter that he dragged
slow and stiff-kneed up the first hill, but sprang forward as
soon as the road was full before him, and <em>got in</em> fresh; than
that he set off in grand style&mdash;broke up midway, and came
in broken-winded. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finis coronat opus.</em></p>

</div>

<p>P.S. I wish I could find a more familiar word than<a class="pagenum" id="Page_237" title="237"></a>
aesthetic for works of taste and criticism. It is, however,
in all respects better, and of more reputable origin, than
belletristic. To be sure, there is <em>tasty</em>; but that has been
long ago emasculated for all unworthy uses by milliners,
tailors, and the androgynous correlatives of both, formerly
called <em>’its</em>, and now yclept dandies. As our language,
therefore, contains no other <em>useable</em> adjective, to express
that coincidence of form, feeling, and intellect, that something,
which, confirming the inner and the outward senses,
becomes a new sense in itself, to be tried by laws of its
own, and acknowledging the laws of the understanding so
far only as not to contradict them; that faculty which, when
possessed in a high degree, the Greeks termed φῖλοκᾶλία, but
when spoken of generally, or in kind only, το αἰσθητικόν;
and for which even our substantive, Taste, is a&mdash;not inappropriate&mdash;but
very inadequate metaphor; there is reason to
hope, that the term <em>aesthetic</em>, will be brought into common
use as soon as distinct thoughts and definite expressions
shall once more become the requisite accomplishment of
a gentleman. So it was in the energetic days, and in the
starry court of our <em>English</em>-hearted Eliza; when trade,
the nurse of freedom, was the enlivening counterpoise of
agriculture, not its alien and usurping spirit; when commerce
had all the enterprise, and more than the romance
of war; when the precise yet pregnant terminology of the
schools gave bone and muscle to the diction of poetry and
eloquence, and received from them in return passion and
harmony; but, above all, when from the self-evident truth,
that what <em>in kind</em> constitutes the superiority of man to
animals, the same <em>in degree</em> must constitute the superiority
of men to each other, the practical inference was drawn that
every proof of these distinctive faculties, being in a <em>tense</em> and
<em>active</em> state, that even the sparks and crackling of mental electricity,
in the sportive approaches and collisions of ordinary
intercourse, (such as we have in the wit-combats of Bene<a class="pagenum" id="Page_238" title="238"></a>dict
and Beatrice, of Mercutio, and in the dialogues assigned
to courtiers and gentlemen, by all the dramatic writers of
that reign,) are stronger indications of natural superiority,
and, therefore, more becoming signs and accompaniments
of <em>artificial</em> rank, than apathy, studied mediocrity, and the
ostentation of wealth. When I think of the vigour and
felicity of style characteristic of the age from Edward VI to
the restoration of Charles, and observable in the letters and
family memoirs of noble families&mdash;take, for instance, the
<cite>Life of Colonel Hutchinson</cite>, written by his widow&mdash;I cannot
suppress the wish&mdash;O that the <em>habits</em> of those days could
return, even though they should bring pedantry and Euphuism
in their train!<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Coleridge and the Gillmans had gone to Ramsgate for a
holiday while Allsop had gone to Derbyshire. The next
letter is from Ramsgate.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_195"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 195. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Oct. 20, 1821.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>Not a day has passed since we left Highgate in
which I have not been tracing you in spirit up and down
the Glens and Dells of Derbyshire, while my feet only have
been in commune with the sandy beach here at Ramsgate.
Once when I had stopped and stood stone still for some
minutes, Mrs. Gillman’s call snatched me away from a spot
opposite to a house, to the second-floor window of which I
had been gazing, as if I had feared, yet expected, to see you
passing to and fro by it. These, however, were visions to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_239" title="239"></a>
which I had myself given the commencing act&mdash;fabrics of
which the “I wonder where Allsop is now” had laid the
foundation stone. But for the last three days your image,
alone or lonely in an unconcerning crowd of human figures,
has forced itself on my sleep in dreams of the rememberable
kind, accompanied with the feeling of being afraid to
go up to you&mdash;and now of letting you pass by unnoticed,
from want of courage to ask you, what was most on my
mind&mdash;respecting the one awful to me because so awfully
dear to you&mdash;(for there is a <em>religion in all deep love</em>, but the
love of a Mother is, at your age, the veil of softer light
between the Heart and the Heavenly Father!) Mrs. Gillman
likewise has been thinking of you both asleep and awake:
and so, though I know not how to direct my letter, yet a
letter I am resolved to write.</p>

<p>I am sure, my dear Friend! that if aught can be a comfort
to you in affliction or an addition to your joy in the hour of
Thanksgiving, it will be to know, and to be reminded of
your knowledge, that I feel as your own heart in all that
concerns you. Next to this I have to tell you, that the Sea
Air and the Sea Plunges, and the leisure of mind, with
regular devotion of the Daylight to exercise (for I write only
after tea), have been auspicious, beyond my best hopes,
to my health and spirits. The change in my looks is
beyond the present reality, but may be veracious as <em>prophecy</em>,
though somewhat exaggerating as <em>history</em>. The same in all
essentials holds good of Mrs. Gillman; and I am most
pleased that the improvement in her looks and strength has
been gradual though rapid. First she got rid, in the course
of four or five days, of the <em>Positives</em> of the wrong sort&mdash;<em>e.g.</em>
the blackness under the eyes and the thinness of the cheeks&mdash;and
now she is acquiring the Positives of the right kind,
her eyes brightening, her face becoming plump, and a
delicate, yet cool and steady colour, stealing upon her
cheeks. Mr. Gillman too is uncommonly well since his<a class="pagenum" id="Page_240" title="240"></a>
second arrival here. The first week his arm, the absorbents
of which had been perilously poisoned by opening a body,
was a sad drawback, and prevented his bathing. In short,
we are all better than we could have anticipated; and the
better we are, the more I long, and we all wish you to be
with us. If you <em>can</em> come, though but for a few days, I pray
you come to us. In grief or gladness, we shall grieve less,
and (I need not say) be more glad, by seeing you, by
having you with <em>us</em>. I will not say <em>write</em>, for I would a
thousand times rather have you plump in on me, unannounced;
but yet write, unless this be possible. We have
an excellent house, with beds enough for half a dozen
Allsops, if so many there were or could be, the situation
the very best in all Ramsgate (Wellington Crescent, East
Cliff, Ramsgate); and we, or rather Mrs. Gillman’s voice
and manner, procured it <em>shameful cheap</em> for the size and
accommodations.</p>

<p>I am called to dinner; so God bless you, and receive all
our loves, my very dear friend.</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_196"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 196. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Ramsgate, Nov. 2nd, 1821.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>First, let me utter the fervent, God be praised! for
the glad tidings respecting your dear Mother, which would
have given an abounding interest to a far less interesting<a class="pagenum" id="Page_241" title="241"></a>
letter. May she be long preserved both to enjoy and reward
your love and piety! And now I will try to answer the
other contents of your letter, as satisfactorily I <em>hope</em>, as I am
sure it will be sincerely and affectionately. Conscious how
heedfully, how watchfully I cross-examined myself whether
or no my anxiety for your earthly happiness and free exercise
of head and heart had not <em>warped</em> the attention which it
was my purpose to give whole and undivided to the one
Question&mdash;What is the Right, I can repeat (with as much
confidence as the slippery and Protean nature of all self-inquisition
and the great <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</em> likelihood of my reason
being tampered with by my affections, will sanction me in
expressing) what I have already more than once said, viz.,
that I hold it incredible, at least improbable to the utmost
extent, that you and I should decide differently in any one
definite instance. Let a case be stated with all its <em>particulars</em>,
personal and circumstantial, with its antecedents and <em>involved</em>
(<em>n.b.</em>&mdash;not its contingent or apprehended) consequents&mdash;and
my faith in the voice within, whenever the heart
desiringly listens thereto, will not allow me to fear that our
verdict should be diverse. If this be true, as true it is, it
follows&mdash;that we have attached a different import to the
same terms in some general proposition;&mdash;and that, in
attempting to generalise my convictions briefly, and yet
comprehensively, I have worded it either incorrectly or
obscurely. On the other hand, your communications likewise,
my dear friend! were indefinite&mdash;“taught light to
counterfeit a gloom;” and love left in the dusk of twilight
is apt to fear the worst, or rather, to think of worse than it
fears, and the momentary transformations of posts and
bushes into apparitions and foot-pads must not be interpreted
as symptoms of brain fever or depraved vision.</p>

<p>And now, my dearest Allsop! why should it be “a <em>melancholy</em>
reflection, that the three most affectionate, gentle, and
estimable women in your world are the three from whom<a class="pagenum" id="Page_242" title="242"></a>
you have learnt almost to undervalue their sex?” In other
words those who in their reasonings have supposed as
possible, not even improbable, that women can be unworthy
and insincere in their expressions of attachment to men,
the frequency of which it is as impossible, living open-eyed,
not to have ascertained, as it is with a heart awake to what
a woman ought to be, and those of whom you speak substantially<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
are. Why should this be a melancholy reflection?
(Thursday, Nov. 1st. A fatality seems to hang over this
letter; I will not, however, defer the continuation for the
purpose of explaining its suspension.) Why, dearest friend,
a melancholy reflection? Must not those women who have
the highest sense of womanhood, who know what their sex
may be, and who feel the rightfulness of their own claim to
be loved with honour, and honoured with love, have likewise
the keenest sense of the contrary? Understand a few
foibles as incident to humanity; take as matters of course
that need not be mentioned, because we know that in the
least imperfect a glance of the womanish will shoot across
the womanly, and there are Mirandas and Imogens, a Una,
a Desdemona, out of fairy land; rare, no doubt, yet less
rare than their counterparts among men in real life. Now
can such a woman not be conscious, must she not feel how
great the happiness is that a woman is capable of communicating,
say rather <em>of being</em> to a man of sense and sensibility,
pure of heart, and capable of appreciating, cherishing, and
repaying her virtues? Can she feel this, and not shrink
from the contemplation of a contrary lot? Can she know
this, and not know what a sore evil, fearful in its heart-withering
affliction in proportion to the capacity of being
blessed, a weak, artful, or worthless woman is&mdash;perhaps in
her <em>own</em> experience has been? And if she happen to know
a young Man, know him as the good, and only the good,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_243" title="243"></a>
know each other&mdash;if he were precious to her, as a younger
brother to a matron sister&mdash;and so that she could not dwell
on his principles, dispositions, manners, without the thought&mdash;“If
I had an only daughter, and she all a mother ever
prayed for, one other prayer should I offer&mdash;that, freely
chosen and choosing, she should enable me to call this man
my son!” would you not more than pardon even an excess
of anxiety, even an error of judgment, proceeding from
a disinterested dread of his taking a step irrevocable, and,
if unhappy, miserable beyond all other misery, that of guilt
alone excepted? Especially if there were no known particulars
to guide her judgment&mdash;if that judgment were given
avowedly, on the mere unbelieved possibility, on an
unsupposed supposition of the worst.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Gillman I have always admired, what indeed I
have found more or less an accompaniment of womanly
excellence wherever found, a high opinion of her own sex
comparatively, and a partiality for female society. I know
that her strongest prejudices against individual men have
originated in their professed disbelief of such a thing as
female friendship, or in some similar brutish forgetfulness
that woman is an immortal soul; and as to all parts of
the female character, so chiefly and especially to the best,
noblest and highest&mdash;to the germs and yearnings of immortality
in the man. I have much to say on this, and shall
now say it with comfort, because I can think of it as a pure
Question of Thought. But I will not now keep this letter
any longer.</p>

mine, written on my birthday. A neglect of this kind may
be forgivable, but it is utterly inexcusable; a Blind-worm

<p class="dateline">Saturday Afternoon, Nov. 17th, (1821).</p>

<p>At length, my dear friend! we are safe and (I hope)
sound at Highgate. We would fain have returned, as we
went, by the Steam-vessel, but for two reasons; one that
there was none to go by, the other that Mr. Gillman thought
it hazardous from the chance of November fogs on the river.
<em>Likewise</em>, my dear Allsop, I have <em>two</em> especial reasons for
wishing that it may be in your power to dine with us tomorrow;
first, it will give you so much real pleasure to see
my improved looks, and how <em>very well</em> Mrs. Gillman has
come back. I need not tell you, that your sister cannot be
dearer to <em>you</em>&mdash;and you are no ordinary brother&mdash;than Mrs.
Gillman is to me; and you will therefore readily understand
me when I say, that I look at the manifest and (as it was
gradual), I hope permanent change in her countenance,
expression, and motion, with a sort of <em>pride</em> of comfort;
second (and in one respect more urgent), my anxiety to
consult you on the subject of a proposal made to me by
Anster, before I return an answer, which I must do speedily.
I cannot conclude without assuring you how important a
part your love and esteem constitute of the happiness, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" title="245"></a>
through that (I will yet venture to hope) of the utility, of
your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="dateline">Monday Morning (&mdash;1821).</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>Ab Hydromania, Hydrophobia: from Water-lust
comes Water-dread. But this is a violent metaphor, and
disagreeable to boot. Suppose then, by some caprice or
colic of nature, an Aqueduct split on this side of the slider
or Sluice-gate, the two parts removed some thirty feet from
each other, and the communication kept up only by a hollow
reed split lengthways, of just enough width and depth to
lay one’s finger in; the likeness would be fantastic to be
sure, but still it would be no inapt likeness or emblem of
the state of mind in which I feel myself as often as I have
just received a letter from you!&mdash;and when, after the first
flush of interest and rush of thoughts stirred up by it, I sit
down, or am about to sit down, to write in answer, a poor
fraction, or finger-breadth of the intended reply fills up
three-fourths of my paper; so sinking under the impracticability
of saying what seemed of use to say, I substitute
what there is no need to say at all&mdash;the expression of my
wishes, and the Love, Regard, and Affection, in which they
originate.</p>

<p>For the future, therefore, I am determined, whenever I
have any time, however short, to write whatever is first in
mind, and to send it off in the self-same hour.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I was most affected or delighted
with your last letter. It will endear Flower de Luce Court
to me above all other remembrances of past efforts; and
the pain, the restless aching, that comes instantly with the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_246" title="246"></a>
thought of giving out my soul and spirit where you cannot
be present, where I could not see your beloved countenance
glistening with the genial <em>spray</em> of the outpouring; this, in
conjunction with your anxiety and that of Mr. and Mrs.
Gillman concerning my health, is the most efficient, I may
say, imperious of the <em>retracting</em> influences as to the Dublin
scheme.</p>

<p>Basil Montagu called on me yesterday. I could not but
be amused to hear from him, as well as from Mrs. Chisholm
and two other visitors, the instantaneous expression of
surprise at the apparent change in my health, and the certain
improvement of my looks. One lady said, “Well! Mr.
Coleridge really <em>is</em> very handsome.”</p>

<p>Highgate is in high feud with the factious stir against the
governors of the chapel, one of whom I was advising against
a reply addressed to the inhabitants as an <em>inconsistency</em>.
“But, sir, we would not carry any thing to an extreme!”
<span class="smcap">This Is the Darling Watch-word of Weak Men</span>, <em>when
they sit down on the edges of two stools. Press them to act on
fixed principles, and they talk of extremes</em>; as if there were or
could be any way of avoiding them but by keeping close to
a fixed principle, <em>which is a principle only because it is the one
medium between two extremes</em>.</p>

<p>P.S. Our friend Gillman sees the factious nature and
origin of the proceedings in so strong a light, and feels so
indignantly, that I am constantly afraid of his honesty
spirting out to his injury. If I had the craft of a Draughtsman,
I would paint Gillman in the character of Honesty,
levelling a pistol (with “Truth” on the barrel) at Sutton,
in the character of Modern Reform, and myself as a <em>Dutch</em><a class="pagenum" id="Page_247" title="247"></a>

<h3><a id="LETTER_199"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 199. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">January 25th, 1822.</p>

<p>Dearest Friend,</p>

<p>My main reason for wishing that Mrs. Gillman should
have made her call on Mrs. Allsop, or that Mrs. Allsop
would waive the ceremony, and taking the willingness for
the act, and the præsens <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in rus</em> (if Highgate deserves that
name) for the future <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in urbe</em>, would accompany you hither,
on the earliest day convenient to you both, is, that I cannot
help feeling the old inkling to press you to spend the
Sunday with me, and yet feel a something like impropriety
in so doing. Speaking confidentially, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">et inter nosmet</em>, if it
were prognosticable that dear Charles would be half as
delightful as when we were last with him, and as pleasant
relatively to the probable impressions on a stranger to him
as Mary always is, I should still ask you to fulfil our first
expectation. As it is, I must be content to wish it; and
leave the rest to your knowledge of the circumstantial pro’s
and con’s. Only remember, that what is dear to you
becomes dear to me, and that whatever can in the least
add to happiness in which you are interested, is a duty
which I cannot neglect without injury to my own. <em>I am
convinced that your happiness is in your own possession.</em><a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" title="248"></a></p>

<p>One part of your letter gave me exceeding comfort&mdash;that
in which you spoke of the peculiar sentiment awakened
or inspired <em>at first sight</em>. <em>This is an article of my philosophic
creed.</em></p>

<p>And now for my pupil schemes. Need I say that the
verdict of your judgment, after a sufficient hearing, would
determine me to abandon a plan of the expediency and
probable result of which I was less sceptical than I am of the
present? But first let me learn from you whether you had
before your mind, at the moment that you formed your
opinion, the circumstance of my being already in some sort
engaged to <em>one</em> pupil already: that with Mr. Stutfield and
Mr. Watson I have already proceeded on two successive
Thursdays, and completed the introduction and the first
chapter, amounting to somewhat more than a closely-printed
octavo sheet, requiring no such revision as would render
transcription necessary; and that three or four more young
men at the table will make no addition, or rather no change.
Mr. Gillman thought my agreeing to receive Stutfield advisable.
Mrs. G. did not indeed influence me by any express
wish, but thought that this was the most likely way in which
my work would proceed with regularity and constancy; in
short, it was, or seemed to be, a <em>bird in the hand</em>, that, in
conjunction with other reliable sources, would remove my
anxiety with regard to <em>increasing</em> any positive pressure on
their finances of former years; so that if I could not lessen,
I should prevent the deficit from growing. On all these
grounds I did&mdash;I need not say down right&mdash;<em>engage</em> myself,
but I certainly permitted Mr. Stutfield to make the trial in
such a form that I scarcely know whether I can, in the
spirit of the expectation I excited, be the first to cry <em>off</em>, he
appearing fully satisfied and in good earnest. Now, supposing
this to be the state of the case, how would my work
fare the better by dictating it to two amanuenses instead of
five or six, if I get so many? For the occasional explanations,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_249" title="249"></a>
and the necessity of removing difficulties and misapprehensions,
are a real advantage in a work which I am
peculiarly solicitous to have “level with the plainest
capacities.” To be sure, on the other hand, I <em>might</em> go on
three days in the week instead of one, and let the work
outrun the lectures, but just so I <em>might</em> on the plan of an
increased number of auditors; and secondly, so many little
obstacles start up when it is not <em>fore</em>-known that on such a
day I <em>must</em> do so and so. I need not explain myself further.
You can understand the “I would not ask you, but it is
only&mdash;” “and but that&mdash;” “I pray do not take any <em>time</em>
about it,” etc., etc., added to my <em>startings</em> off.</p>

<p>If I do not see you on Sunday, do not fail to write to me,
for of course I shall take no step till I am quite certain that
your judgment is <em>satisfied</em> one way or other, for I am with
unwrinkled confidence and inmost reclination,</p>

<p>It will be seen from this letter that Coleridge was falling
behind with his Board money due to Gillman: hence his
anxiety to form a philosophical class composed of Mr. Seth

<h3><a id="LETTER_200"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 200. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">March 4th, 1822.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I have been much more than ordinarily unwell for
more than a week past&mdash;my sleeps worse than my vigils,
my nights than my days;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent4">&mdash;&mdash;The night’s dismay</div>
    <div class="line">Sadden’d and stunned the intervening day;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but last night I had not only a calmer night, without<a class="pagenum" id="Page_250" title="250"></a>
roaming in my dreams through any of Swedenborg’s Hells
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modéré</em>; but arose this morning lighter and with a sense of
<em>relief</em>.</p>

<p>I scarce know whether the enclosed Detenu<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> is worth
enclosing or reading. I fancy that I send it because I
cannot write at any length that which is even tolerably
adequate to what I wish to say. Mrs. Gillman returned
from town&mdash;very much pleased with her reception by Mrs.
Allsop, and with the impression that it would be her
husband’s fault if she did not make him a happy home.</p>

<p>I shall make you smile, as I did dear Mary Lamb, when
I say that you sometimes mistake my position. As individual
to individual, from my childhood, I do not remember feeling
myself either superior or inferior to any human being; except
by an act of my own will in cases of real or imagined moral
or intellectual superiority. In regard to worldly rank, from
eight years old to nineteen, I was habituated, nay, naturalized,
to look up to men circumstanced as you are, as my superiors&mdash;a
large number of our governors, and almost <em>all</em> of those
whom we regarded as greater men still, and whom we saw
most of, viz. our committee governors, were such&mdash;and as
neither awake nor asleep have I any other feelings than
what I had at Christ’s Hospital, I distinctly remember that
I felt a little flush of pride and consequence&mdash;just like what
we used to feel at school when the boys came running to
us&mdash;“Coleridge! here’s your friends want you&mdash;they are
quite <em>grand</em>,” or “It is quite a <em>lady</em>”&mdash;when I first heard
who you were, and laughed at myself for it with that
pleasurable sensation that, spite of my sufferings at that
school, still accompanies any sudden re-awakening of our
school-boy feelings and notions. And oh, from sixteen to
nineteen what hours of Paradise had Allen and I in escorting
the Miss Evanses home on a Saturday, who were then
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_251" title="251"></a>at a milliner’s whom we used to think, and who I believe
really was, such a nice lady;&mdash;and we used to carry thither,
of a summer morning, the pillage of the flower gardens
within six miles of town, with Sonnet or Love Rhyme
wrapped round the nose-gay. To be feminine, kind, and
genteelly (what I should now call neatly) dressed, these
were the only things to which my head, heart, or imagination
had any polarity, and what I was then, I still am.</p>

<p class="dateline">March 22nd, 1822.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>Mr. Watson is but now returned. I was about to set off to your house and
take turns with Mrs. Allsop in watching you. It is a comfort to hear
from Watson that he thinks you look not only better than when he saw you
before, but more promisingly.</p>

<p>is the adage of the old Schola Salernitana, and his belief and judgment.
Would to God that there were any druggist or apothecary within the
king’s dominions where I could procure for you the first ingredient of
the recipe, fresh and genuine. I would soon make up the prescription,
have the credit of curing you, and then make my fortune by advertising
the nostrum under the name of Dr. Samsartorius, <cite>Carbonijugius’s Panacea
Salernitana&mdash;&mdash;iensis</cite>.</p>

<p>You will have thought, I fear, that I had forgotten my
promise of sending you Charles Lamb’s <cite>epistola porcina</cite>.
But it was not so. I now enclose it, and when you return
it I will make a copy for you if you wish it, for I think<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" title="252"></a>
that writing in your present state will be most injurious to you.</p>

<p>I am interrupted&mdash;“a poor lad, very ragged, he says Mr.
Dowling has sent him to you to show you his poetry.”&mdash;“Well!
desire him to step up, Maria!”</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Green left me, Mrs. Gillman delivered
your letter. I am not sorry, therefore, that the <cite>Wild Irish
Boy</cite> made it too late to finish the above for that day’s post.
His name, poor lad! is Esmond Wilton; his mother, I
guess, was poetical. But I will reserve him for a dish on
our table of chat when we meet.&mdash;In reply to your affectionate
letter what can I say, but that from all that you
say, write or do, I receive but two impressions; first a full,
cordial, and unqualified assurance of your love towards me,
a genial unclouded faith in the entireness and steadfastness
of your more than friendship, sustained and renewed by the
consciousness of a responsive attachment in myself, that
blends the affections of parent, brother and friend,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">A love of thee that seems, yet cannot greater be;</p>

<p>and secondly, impressions of grief or joy, according, and in
proportion to, the information I receive, or the inferences
that I draw, respecting your health, ease of heart and mind,
and all the events, incidents, and circumstances, that affect,
or are calculated to affect, both or either. Only this in
addition&mdash;whatever <em>else</em> may pass through your mind, never,
from any motive, or with any view, withhold from me your
thoughts, your feelings, and your sorrows. What if they be
momentary, winged thoughts, not native, that blowing
weather has driven out of their course, and to which your
mind has allowed thorough flight, but neither nest, perch,
nor halting room? Send them onward to pass through
mine; and between us both, we shall be better able to give
a good account of them! What if they are the offspring of
low or perturbed spirits&mdash;the changelings of ill health or<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253" title="253"></a>
disquietude? So much the rather communicate them.
When on the white paper, they are already out of <em>us</em>; and
when the letter is gone, they will not stay long behind; the
very anticipation of the answer will have answered them,
and superseded the need, though not the wish, of its arrival.
And shall I not, think you, take them for what they are?
With what comfort, with what security, could I receive or
read your letters, or you mine, if we either of us had reason
to believe, that whatever affliction had befallen, or discomfort
was harassing, or anxiety was weighing on the heart, the
other would say no word of or about it, under the plea of
not transplanting thorns, or whatever other excuse a depressed
fancy might invent, in order to transmute <em>unfriendly
withholding</em> into a self-sacrifice of tenderness. If you had
come to stay with me while I lay on a bed of pain, it would
grieve you indeed, if, from an imagined duty of not grieving
you, I should suppress every expression of suffering, and not
tell you where my pain was, or whether it was greater or less.
<em>Grant</em> that I was rendered anxious or heavy at heart, or
keenly sorrowful, by any tidings you had communicated
respecting yourself! <em>Should</em> it not be so? Ought it not to
be so? Will not the Joy be greater when the Cloud is
passed off&mdash;greater in <em>kind</em>, nobler, better&mdash;because I should
feel it was my <em>right</em>? And is there not a dignity and a
hidden Healing in the suffering itself&mdash;which is soothed in
the wish and tempered in the endeavour of removing, or
lessening, or supporting it, in the Soul of a dear Friend?
However trifling my vexations are, yet if they vex me, and
I am writing to you, to you I will unbosom them, my
dear ... and my serious sorrows and hindrances I will
still less keep back from you. General Truths, Discussions,
Poems, Queries&mdash;all these are parts of my nature, <em>often</em>
uppermost; and when they are so, you have them&mdash;and I
like well to write to, and to hear from you on them&mdash;but
these I might write to the Public: and with all Christian<a class="pagenum" id="Page_254" title="254"></a>
respect for that gentleman, I love your little finger better
than his whole multitudinous Body.</p>

<p>Give my love to Mrs. Allsop, and tell her I will try to
deserve hers.</p>

<p>“The letter here alluded to,” says Allsop, “is a most
delightful communication from Charles Lamb; which, with
the hints thrown out by Manning, as to the probable origin
of roast meat, were afterwards interwoven into that paper on
<cite>Roast Pig</cite>, one of the best of Lamb’s productions.”</p>

<p class="dateline">9 Mch. 1822.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Dear C.,</p>

<p>It gives me great satisfaction to hear that the Pig turned out so
  well&mdash;they are interesting creatures at a certain age. What a pity
  such buds should blow out into the maturity of rank bacon! You had all
  some of the crackling&mdash;and brain sauce&mdash;did you remember to rub it
  with butter, and gently dredge it a little, just before the crisis?
  Did the eyes come away kindly with no Œdipean avulsion?&mdash;was the
  crackling the colour of the ripe pomegranate?&mdash;had you no damned
  complement of boiled neck of mutton before it to blunt the edge of
  delicate desire?&mdash;did you flesh maiden teeth in it?</p>

<p>Not that I sent the Pig, or can form the remotest guess what part Owen
  (our landlord) could play in the business. I never knew him give any
  thing away in his life&mdash;he would not begin with strangers. I suspect
  the Pig after all was meant for me&mdash;but at the unlucky juncture of
  time being absent, the present, somehow, went round to Highgate.</p>

<p>To confess an honest truth, a Pig is one of those things I could never
  think of sending away. Teals, widgeons, snipes, barn-door fowls,
  ducks, geese, your tame villatic things&mdash;Welsh mutton&mdash;collars of
  brawn&mdash;sturgeon, fresh and pickled&mdash;your potted char&mdash;Swiss
  cheeses&mdash;French pies&mdash;early grapes&mdash;muscadines,&mdash;I impart as freely to
  my friends as to myself,&mdash;they are but <em>self</em>-extended; but pardon me
  if I stop somewhere&mdash;<em>where the fine feeling of benevolence giveth a
  higher smack than the sensual rarity; there my friends</em> (or any good
  man) <em>may command me</em>; but pigs are pigs; and I myself am therein
  nearest to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" title="255"></a> myself; nay, I should think it an affront, an undervaluing
  done to Nature, who bestowed such a boon upon me, if, in a churlish
  mood, I parted with the precious gift. One of the bitterest pangs I
  ever felt of remorse was when a child&mdash;my kind old aunt had strained
  her pocket-strings to bestow a sixpenny whole plum-cake upon me. In my
  way home through the Borough, I met a venerable old man&mdash;not a
  mendicant&mdash;but thereabouts; a <em>look-beggar</em>&mdash;not a verbal
  petitionist&mdash;and, in the coxcombry of taught charity, I gave away the
  cake to him. I walked on a little <em>in all the pride of an evangelical
  peacock</em>, when of a sudden my old aunt’s kindness crossed me&mdash;<em>the sum
  it was to her</em>&mdash;<em>the pleasure that she had a right to expect that I,
  not the old impostor, should take in eating her cake</em>&mdash;the damned
  ingratitude by which, under the colour of a Christian virtue, I had
  frustrated her cherished purpose. I sobbed, wept, and took it to heart
  so grievously, that I think I never suffered the like. And I was
  right; it was a piece of unfeeling hypocrisy, and proved a lesson to
  me ever after. The cake has long been masticated, consigned to the
  dunghill, with the ashes of that unseasonable pauper.</p>

<p>But when Providence, who is better to us all than our aunts, gives me
  a Pig, remembering my temptation and my fall, I shall endeavour to act
  towards it more in the spirit of the donor’s purpose.</p>

<p>Yours (short of Pig) to command in everything,</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>There was neither self nor unself in the flash or jet of pleasurable
sensation with which I saw the old <img alt="" src="images/pallmall.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" /> tea-canister top
surmounting my own name, but a mere unreflecting gladness, a sally of
inward welcoming, on finding you near to me again. I am indebted to it,
however, for this, and the dear and affectionate letter that sustained
and substantiated it, like a gleam of sunshine ushering in a genial
south-west, and setting all the birds a singing; while the joy at the
recall of the old, dry, <em>scathy</em>, viceroy of the discouraged spring, the
Tartar laird from the north-east,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" title="256"></a> augments yet loses itself in the
delight at the arrival of the long-wished-for successor to his native
realm, gave a sudden spur and kindly sting to my spirits, the
restorative effects of which I felt on rising this morning, as soon
after, at least, as the pain which always greets me on awaking, and
never fails to be my Valentine for every day in the year, had taken its
leave.</p>

<p>Charles and Mary Lamb are to dine with us on Sunday next, and I hope it
will be both pleasant and possible for you and Mrs. Allsop to complete
the party; and if so, I will take care to be quite <em>free</em> to enjoy your
society from the moment of your arrival, and I hope that Mrs. Allsop
will not be too much tired for me to show her some of our best views and
walks; and perhaps the nightingales may commence their ditties on or by
that day, for I have daily expected them.</p>

<p>Need I say what thoughts rush into my mind when I read
a letter from you, or think of your love towards me.</p>

experience of Messrs. &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in my own immediate
concerns had been, of the latter especially, I was<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" title="258"></a>
not prepared for their late behaviour, or, to use Anster’s
words on the occasion, for “so piteous a lowering of human
nature,” as the contents of Mr. W.’s letters were calculated
to produce.</p>

<p>I have at <em>length</em>&mdash;for I really tore it out of my brain, as it
were piecemeal, a bit one day and a bit the day after&mdash;finished
and sent off a letter of two folio <em>large</em> and close-written
sheets&mdash;nine sides equal to twelve of this size paper&mdash;to
Mr. Dawes, of Ambleside, the rough copy of which I
will show you when we meet.</p>

<p>The exceeding kindness and uncalculating instantaneous
and decisive generous friendship of the Gillmans, and the
presence of <em>you</em> to my Thoughts, prevent all approach to
misanthropy in my Feelings, but <em>for that reason</em> render
those feelings more <em>acutely</em> painful. If I did not know that
Genius, like Reason, though not perhaps so entirely, is
rather a presence vouchsafed, like a guardian spirit, to an
Individual, which departs whenever the Evil Self becomes
decisively predominant, and not like Talents or the Powers
of the Understanding, a personal property&mdash;the contemplation
of &mdash;&mdash;’s<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> late and present state of Head and Heart
would overwhelm me. But I must not represent my neglect
as worse than I myself hold it to be; for I feel that I could
not have omitted it had I not known that you were so
busily engaged.</p>

<p>Charles and Mary Lamb and Mr. Green dine with us on
Sunday next, when we are to see Mathews’ Picture Gallery.
Can you and Mrs. Allsop join the party? or, if Mrs. Allsop’s
health should make this hazardous or too great an exertion,
can you come yourself? I am sure she will forgive me for
putting the question.</p>

<p class="dateline">June 29th, 1822.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,</p>

<p>As fervent a prayer, as glow-trembling a joy, thanksgiving
that seeks to steady itself by prayer, and prayer that
dissolves itself into thanks and gladness, as ever eddied in
or streamed onward from love and friendship, for pain and
dread, for travail of body and spirit passed over, and a
mother smiling over the firstborn at her bosom, have sped
toward you from the moment I opened your Letter. For as
if there had been a light suffused along the paper at that
part, “birth of a Daughter after a very short illness,” were
the first words I saw. “Well pleased!” To be sure you are.
It was scarcely a week ago that&mdash;during the only hour free
from visits, visitors, and visitations that we have had to ourselves
for I do not know how long&mdash;Mrs. Gillman and I
had settled the point; and, after a strict, patient, and impartial
poll of the <em>pro’s</em> and <em>con’s</em> on both sides, a Girl it was
to be, and a Girl was returned by a very large majority of
wishes. But as wishes, like strawberries, do not bear carriage
well, or at least require to be poised on the <em>head</em>, I will
send a scanty specimen of the Reasons by way of <cite>Hansel</cite>.
<em>Imprimis</em>, A Girl takes five times as much spoiling to spoil
her. <em>Item.</em>&mdash;It is a great advantage both in respect of
Temper, Manners, and the Quickening of the Faculties, for
a Boy to have a Sister or Sisters a year or two older than
himself.&mdash;But I devote this brief scroll to Feeling: so no
more of disquisition, except it be to declare the entire coincidence
of my experience with yours as to the very rare
occurrence of strong and deep Feeling in conjunction with
free power and vivacity in the expression of it. The most
eminent Tragedians, Garrick for instance, are known to
have had their emotions as much at command, and almost
as much on the surface, as the muscles of their counten<a class="pagenum" id="Page_260" title="260"></a>ances;
and the French, who are all Actors, are proverbially
heartless. Is it that it is a false and feverous state for the
Centre to live in the Circumference? The vital warmth
seldom rises to the surface in the form of sensible Heat,
without becoming hectic and inimical to the Life within, the
only source of real sensibility. Eloquence itself&mdash;I speak of
it as habitual and at call&mdash;too often is, and is always like to
engender, a species of histrionism.</p>

<p>In one of my juvenile poems (on a Friend who died in a
Frenzy Fever), you will find<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> that I was jealous of this in
myself; and that it is (as I trust it is), otherwise, I attribute
mainly to the following causes:&mdash;A naturally, at once searching
and communicative disposition, the necessity of reconciling
the restlessness of an ever-working Fancy with an
intense craving after a resting-place for my Thoughts in
some <em>principle</em> that was derived from experience, but of
which all other knowledge should be but so many repetitions
under various limitations, even as circles, squares,
triangles, etc., etc., are but so many positions of space.
And, lastly, that my eloquence was most commonly excited by
the desire of running away and hiding myself from my personal
and inward feelings, <em>and not for the expression of them</em>,
while doubtless this very effort of feeling gave a passion and
glow to my thoughts and language on subjects of a general<a class="pagenum" id="Page_261" title="261"></a>
nature, that they otherwise would not have had. I fled in a
Circle, still overtaken by the Feelings, from which I was
ever more fleeing, with my back turned towards them; but
above all, my growing deepening conviction of the <em>transcendancy
of the moral to the intellectual</em>, and the inexpressible
comfort and inward strength which I experience myself to
derive as often as I contemplate truth realised into Being by
a human Will; so that, <em>as I cannot love without esteem,
neither can I esteem without loving</em>. Hence I <em>love</em> but few,
but those I love as my own Soul; for I feel that without
them I should&mdash;not indeed cease to be kind and effluent,
but by little and little become a soul-less fixed Star, receiving
no rays nor influences into my Being, <em>a Solitude
which I so tremble at, that I cannot attribute it even to the
Divine Nature</em>.</p>

<p><em>God</em>father or not (have not Girls Godfathers?), the little
lady shall be to me a dear Daughter, and I will make her
love me by loving her own Papa and Mamma. God bless you.</p>

<p>The last letter refers to the birth of “Titania Puckinella,”
as Coleridge loved to call Allsop’s girl. The next letter
refers to Coleridge’s four “griping and grasping sorrows.”
The third sorrow was the break with Sarah Hutchinson, who,
as we have seen, had been one of Coleridge’s good angels,
the “Lady” of <cite>Dejection; an Ode</cite>.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_205"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 205. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Ramsgate, Oct. 8th, 1822.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>In the course of my past life I count four griping
and grasping sorrows, each of which seemed to have my
very heart in its hands, compressing or wringing. The first,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_262" title="262"></a>
when the Vision of a Happy Home sunk for ever, and it
became impossible for me any longer even to hope for
domestic happiness under the name of Husband, when I
was doomed to know</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">That names but seldom meet with Love,</div>
    <div class="line">And Love wants courage without a name!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The second commenced on the night of my arrival (from
Grasmere) in town with Mr. and Mrs. Montagu, when all
the superstructure raised by my idolatrous Fancy during an
enthusiastic and self-sacrificing Friendship of fifteen years&mdash;the
fifteen bright and ripe years, the strong summer of my
Life&mdash;burst like a Bubble! But the Grief did not vanish
with it, nor the love which was the stuff and vitality of the
grief, though they pined away up to the moment of &mdash;&mdash;’s
last total Transfiguration into Baseness; when, with £1,200
a year, and just at the moment that the <em>extraordinary</em> Bankruptcy
of Fenner and Curtis had robbed me of every penny
I had been so many years working for, every penny I possessed
in the world, and involved me in a debt of £150 to
boot, he <em>first</em> regretted that he was not able to pay a certain
bill of mine to his &mdash;&mdash;’s wife’s brother, himself, “never
wanted money so much in his life,” etc. etc.; and an hour
after attempted to extort from me a transfer to himself of all
that I could call my own in the world&mdash;my books&mdash;as the
condition of his paying a debt which in <em>equity</em> was as
much, but in honour and gratitude was far more, <em>his</em> debt
than mine!</p>

<p>My third sorrow was in some sort included in the second;
what the former was to friendship, the latter was to a yet
more inward bond. The former spread a wider gloom over
the world around me, the latter left a darkness deeper within
myself; the former is more akin to indignation, and moody
scorn at my own folly in my weaker moments, and to contemplative
melancholy and alienation from the Past in my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_263" title="263"></a>
ordinary state; the latter had more of self in its character,
but of a Self, emptied&mdash;a gourd of Jonas: and is <em>this</em> it under
which I hoped to have prophesied?</p>

<p>My fourth commenced with the tidings of the charge
against J&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;remitted with the belief and confidence of
the Falsehood of the charge&mdash;relapsed again&mdash;and again&mdash;and
again&mdash;blended with the sad convictions, that neither
E. nor I. thought of or felt towards me as they ought, or
attributed any thing done for them to me; and lastly,
reached its height on the nineteenth day of E.’s fever by
J.’s desertion of him, when it trembled in the scales
whether he should live or die, and the cause of this
desertion first awakening the suspicion that I had been
deliberately deceived and made an accomplice in deceiving
others.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>And yet, in all these four griefs, my recollection, as often
as they were recalled to my mind, turned not to <em>what</em> I
suffered, but on what <em>account</em>&mdash;at worst, I never thought of
the sufferings apart from the causes and occasions of them;
but the latter were ever uppermost. It was reserved for the
interval between six o’clock and twelve on <em>that Saturday</em>
evening to bring a suffering which, do what I will, I cannot
help thinking of and being <em>affrighted</em> by, as a terror of itself&mdash;a
self-subsisting, separate something, detached from the
cause. I cannot help hearing the sound of my voice at the
moment when I ... took me by surprise, and asked me for
the money to pay a debt to, and take leave of, Mr. Williams,
promising to overtake me if possible before I had reached his
aunt Martha’s, but at latest before five. “Nay, say <em>six</em>. Be,
if you can, by five, but <em>say</em> six.” Then, when he had passed
a few steps&mdash;“J&mdash;&mdash; six; O my God! think of the <em>agony</em>,
the <em>sore agony</em>, of every moment after six!” And though he
was not three yards from me, I only saw the colour of his<a class="pagenum" id="Page_264" title="264"></a>
Face through my Tears!&mdash;No more of this! I will finish
this scrawl after my return from the Beach.</p>

<p>When I had left behind me what I had no power to make
better or worse, and arrived at the sea side, I had soon
reason to remember that I was not at <em>home</em>, or at Muddiford,
<em>or</em> at Little Hampton, or at Ramsgate, but under the conjunct
signs of Virgo and the Crab; the one in the wane, the
other in advance, yet in excellent agreement with the former,
by virtue of its rare privilege of advancing backward. In
sober prose, I verily believe we should have found as genial
a birth in a nest hillock of Termites or Bugaboos as with
this single Ant-consanguineous. As soon therefore as dear
Mr. Gillman returned to us, you will not hold it either
strange or unwise that, in agreeing to accompany him to
Dover, the kingdom of France west of Paris, Ramsgate,
Sandwich, and foreign parts in general, I determined to give
myself up to each moment as it came, with no anticipations
and with no recollections, save as far as is involved in the
wish every now and then, that you had been with me; and
in this resolve it was that I destroyed the kit-cat or bust at
least of the letter I had meant to have sent you. But oh!
how often have I wished, and do I wish, that you and
Mrs. Allsop could form a household in common at Ramsgate
with us next year.</p>

<p>And now for your second Letter. What shall I say?
When our Griefs and Fears and agitations are strongly
roused towards one object, we almost want some fresh
memento to remind us that we have other Loves, other Interests.
Forgive me if I tell you that your last letter did, in
something of this way, make me feel afresh, that there was
that in my very heart that called you Son as well as Friend,
and reminded me that a Father’s affection could not exist
exempt from a Father’s anxiety. I am fully aware that
every syllable in the latter half of your letter proceeded
from the strong two-fold desire at once to comfort and con<a class="pagenum" id="Page_265" title="265"></a>ciliate,
and that I ought to regard your remarks as the mere
straining of the Soul towards an End felt and known to be
pure and lovely; and even so I do regard them, yet I
cannot read them without anxiety: not indeed anxious
Thoughts, but anxious Feeling. Sane or insane, fearful
thing it is, when I can be comforted by an assurance of the
latter; but I neither know nor <em>dare</em> hear of any mid state,
of no vague necessities dare I hear. Our own wandering
thoughts may be suffered to become Tyrants over the mind,
of which they are the Offspring and the most effective
Viceroys, or substitutes of that dark and dim spiritual
Personëity, whose whispers and fiery darts holy men have
supposed them to be, and that these may end in the loss, or
rather Forfeiture of Free agency, I doubt not. But, my
dearest friend, I have both the <em>Faith of Reason</em> and the
Voice of Conscience and the assurance of Scripture, that,
“resist the evil one, and he will flee from you.” But for
self-condemnation, J... would never have tampered with
Fatalism; and but for Fatalism, he would never have had
such cause to condemn himself. With truest love,</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_206"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 206. To Gillman</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Ramsgate, 28th Oct., 1822.</p>

<p>Dear Friend,</p>


<p>Words I know are not wanted between you and me.
But there are occasions so awful, there may be instances and
manifestations of friendship so affecting, and drawing up<a class="pagenum" id="Page_266" title="266"></a>
with them so long a train from behind, so many folds of
recollection as they come onward on one’s mind, that it
seems but a mere act of justice to oneself, a debt we owe to
the dignity of our moral nature to give them some record;
a relief which the spirit of man asks and demands to contemplate
in some outward symbol, what it is inwardly
solemnizing. I am still too much under the cloud of past
misgivings, too much of the stun and stupor from the recent
peals and thunder-crush still remains, to permit me to anticipate
others than by wishes and prayers. What the effect
of your unwearied kindness may be on poor M.’s mind and
conduct, I pray fervently, and I feel a cheerful trust that I
do not pray in vain, that on my own mind and spring of
action, it will be proved not to have been wasted. I do inwardly
believe, that I shall yet do something to thank you,
my dear&mdash;in the way in which you would wish to be
thanked&mdash;by doing myself honour.&mdash;Dear friend and
brother of my soul, God only knows how truly, and in the
depth, you are loved and prized by your affectionate friend,</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_207"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 207. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p>Dec. 26th, 1822.</p>

<p>My very dear Friend,</p>

<p>I might with strict truth assign the not only day after
day, but hour after hour employment, if not through the
whole period of my waking time, yet through the whole of
my writing power, as the cause of my not having written to
you with my own hand; but then I ought to add that it was
enforced and kept up by the expectation of seeing you.
There are two ways of giving you pleasure and comfort;
would to God I could have made the one <em>compossible</em> with<a class="pagenum" id="Page_267" title="267"></a>
the other and done both! The first, the having finished the
Logic in its three main divisions,&mdash;as the Canon, or that
which prescribes the rule and form of all <em>conclusion</em> or conclusive
reasoning; second, as the Criterion, or that which
teaches to distinguish truth from falsehood, containing all
the sorts, forms, and sources of error, and means of deceiving
or being deceived; third, as the Organ, or positive
instrument for discovering truth, together with the general
introduction to the whole.</p>

<p>The second was to come to town, and pass a week with
you and Mrs. Allsop. The latter I could not have done,
and yet have been able to send you the present good
tidings that with regard to the former we are in sight of
land; that Mr. Stutfield will give three days in the week for
the next fortnight; and that I have no doubt, notwithstanding
Mrs. Coleridge and my little Sara’s expected arrival
on Friday next, that by the end of January the whole book
will not only have been finished, for <em>that</em> I expect will be
the case next Sunday fortnight, but ready for the press. In
reality, I have <em>now</em> little else but to transcribe, and even
this would in part only be necessary, but that I must of
course dictate the sentences to Mr. Stutfield and Mr. Watson,
and shall therefore avail myself of the opportunity for occasional
correction and improvement. When this is done,
and can be offered as <em>a whole</em> to Murray or other Publisher,
I shall have the Logical Exercises, or the Logic exemplified
and applied in a critique on&mdash;1. Condillac; 2. Paley;
3. The French Chemistry and Philosophy, with other miscellaneous
matters from the present Fashions of the age,
moral and political, ready to go to the press with by the
time the other is printed off; and this without interrupting
the greater work on Religion, of which the first Half, containing
the Philosophy or ideal Truth, possibility, and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
priori</em> probability of the articles of Christian Faith, was completed
on Sunday last.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_268" title="268"></a>Let but these works be once done, and the responsibility
off my conscience, and I have no doubt or dread of afterwards
obtaining an honourable sufficiency, were it only by
school books, and compilations from my own memorandum
volumes. The publication of my Shakspeare and other
similar lectures, sheet per sheet, in <cite>Blackwood</cite>, with the aid
of Mr. Frere’s short-hand copies, and those on the History
of Philosophy in one volume, would nearly suffice.</p>

<p>I was unspeakably delighted to see Mrs. Allsop look so
<em>charmingly</em> well. My affectionate regards to her, and a
heart-uttered Happy, Happy, Happy Christmas to you
both, one for each, and the third for the little girl, who
(Mr. Watson assures me) has now the ground work and
necessary pre-condition of thriving, though it may be some
time before a notable change in the appearances may take
place for the general eye.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Lectures as arranged for <cite>Blackwood</cite>
were probably written out by one of Coleridge’s friends.
The History of Philosophy consisted of the Lectures commenced
14th December 1818. The Logic is still in MS.
(Dykes Campbell, <cite>Life</cite>, 251, note).</p>

<p>Mrs. Coleridge and Sara came to Highgate and remained
till the end of February (<cite>Ainger</cite>, ii, 65, 71). Mrs. Coleridge
wrote that “our visits to Highgate have been productive of
the greatest satisfaction to all parties.” It was at this time
that Sara and her cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge, first
met.</p>

<p>My dear Allsop,</p>

<p>I shall be alone on Sunday, and shall be happy to
spend it with you. Ever since the disappearance of a most
unsightly eruption on my Face I have been, with but short
intermission, annoyed with the noise as of a distant Forge
hammer incessantly sounding, so that for some time I
actually supposed it to be an outward sound. To me, who
never before <em>knew</em> by any sensation that I had a head upon
my shoulders, this you may suppose is extremely harassing
to the spirits and distractive of my attention. Mrs. Gillman,
on stepping from my attic, slipt on the first step of a steep
flight of nine high stairs, precipitated herself and fell head
foremost on the fifth stair; and when at the piercing scream
I rushed out, I found her lying on the landing place, her
head at the wall. Even now the Image, and the Terror of
the Image, blends with the recollection of the Past a strange
expectancy, a fearful sense of a something still to come; and
breaks in, and makes stoppages, as it were, in my Thanks to
God for her providential escape. For an escape we all must
think it, though the small bone of her left arm was broken,
and her wrist sprained. She went without a light, though
(Oh! the vanity of Prophecies, the truth of which can be
established only by the proof of their uselessness) two
nights before I had expostulated with her on this account
with some warmth, having previously more than once
remonstrated against it, on stairs not familiar and without
carpeting.</p>

<p>As I shall <em>rely</em> on your spending Sunday here, and with
me alone, I shall defer to that time all but my tenderest<a class="pagenum" id="Page_270" title="270"></a>
regards to Mrs. Allsop, and the superfluous assurance that
I am evermore, my dearest Allsop,</p>

<h3><a id="LETTER_210"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 210. To Mrs. Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash; 1823).</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Allsop,</p>

<p>Indeed, indeed you have sadly misunderstood my
last hurried note. So over and over again has Mr. Allsop
been assured that every invitation to him included you, so
often has he been asked to consider one meant for both,
that in a few lines scrawled in the dark, with a distracting,
quick, thick, and noisy beating as of a distant forge-hammer
in my head, and, lastly, written, not so much under any expectation
of seeing him (in fact for <em>Christmas</em>-day I had<a class="pagenum" id="Page_271" title="271"></a>
none), as from a nervous jealousy of any customary mark of
respect and affection being omitted, the ceremony of <span class="smcap">expressing</span>
your name did not occur to me. But the blame,
whatever it be, lies with me, wholly, exclusively on me; for
on asking <em>Mr.</em> Gillman whether an invitation had been sent
to you, he replied by asking me if I had not spoken, and on
my saying it was now too late, he still desired me to write,
his words being,&mdash;“For though Allsop must know how glad
we always are to see him, yet still, as far as it is a mark of
respect, it is his due.” Accordingly I wrote. But after the
letter had been sent to the post, on going to Mrs. Gillman
to learn how she was, and saying that I had just scrawled
a note in the dark in order not to miss the post, <em>she</em> expressed
her disapprobation as nearly as I can remember in these
words:&mdash;“I do not think a mere ceremony any mark of
respect to intimate friends. How, in such weather as this,
and short days, can it be supposed that Mrs. Allsop could
either leave the children or take them? But to expect Mr.
Allsop to dine away from his family at this time is what I
would not even appear to do, for I should think it very
wrong if he did.” I was vexed, and could only reply,&mdash;“This
comes of doing things of a hurry. However, Allsop
knows me too well to attribute to me any other feeling or
purpose than the real ones.” I give you my word and honour,
my dear madame, that these were, to the best of my
recollection, the very words; but I am quite <span class="smcap">certain</span> that
they contain the same substance. And for this reason, knowing
how it would vex and fret on her spirits that you had
been offended, and (if the letter of itself without any interpretation
derived from the character or known sentiments of
the writer were to decide it), justly offended, I have not
shown her your note, nor mentioned the circumstance to
her; for this sad accident has pulled her down sadly, coming
too in conjunction with the distressful state of my health
and spirits; for such is my state at present, that though I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_272" title="272"></a>
would myself have run any hazard to have spent to-morrow
with Miss Southey, my own Sara’s friend and twin-sister,
and with Miss Wordsworth at Monkhouse’s, in Gloster-place;
yet Mr. Gillman has both dissuaded and forbidden
me as my medical adviser. I trust, therefore, that finding
Mrs. Gillman <em>more</em> than <em>blameless</em>, and that in me the blame
was in the judgment and not in the <em>intention</em>, you will think
no more of it, but do me the <em>justice</em> to believe that any intentions
or feelings of which I have been conscious have
ever been of a kind most contrary to any form of disrespect,
omissive or commissive; to which, let me add, that <em>I should</em>
be doing what Mr. Allsop (I am sure) would <em>not</em> do, <em>if having</em>
shown you <em>consciously</em> any <em>dis</em>respect I continued to subscribe
myself <em>his</em> friend, not to speak of any profession of being
what in very truth I am, my dear Mrs. Allsop,</p>

<p>Thomas Monkhouse referred to in the above letter was a
cousin of Mrs. Wordsworth, with whom Lamb on 4th March
1823 “dined in Parnassus with Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Rogers, and Tom Moore, half the poetry of England clustered
and constellated in Gloucester Place” (<cite>Ainger</cite>, ii, 69).</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_211"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 211. To Mr. and Mrs. Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">Grove, Highgate, April 8th, 1824.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Allsop,</p>

<p>There are three rolls of paper, Mr. Wordsworth’s
translation of the first, second, and third books, two in
letter-paper, one in a little writing-book, in the drawer under
the side-board in your dining-room. Be so good as to put
them up and give them to the bearer should Mr. Allsop not
be at home.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_273" title="273"></a>My dear Allsop,</p>

<p>You I know will have approved of my instant compliance
with Mr. Gillman’s request of returning with him;
and I know, too, that both Mrs. Allsop and yourself will
think it superfluous in me to tell you what you must be sure
I cannot but feel. I trust that when I next return from you,
I shall have&mdash;not to thank you less&mdash;but with less painful
recollections of the trouble and anxiety I have occasioned
you.</p>

<p>In the agitation of leaving Mrs. Allsop, I forgot to take
with me the translation of Virgil. Could I, that is, dared I,
wait till Sunday, I might make it one way of inducing you
to spend the day with me. Upon the whole, however, I had
better send than increase my anxieties, so I will send Riley
with this note.</p>

<p>My Grandfatherly love and kisses to the Fairy Prattler
and the meek boy. I did heave a long-drawn wish this
morning, as the sun and the air too were so genial, that the
latter had been in the good woman’s house at Highgate well
wrapped up. A fortnight would do wonders for the dear
little fellow. You and Mrs. Allsop may rely on it that I
would see him every day during his stay here, if there were
only one hour in which it did not rain vehemently.</p>

<p>Coleridge wrote about this time to Wordsworth regarding

Wordsworth’s entering into rivalry with Dryden.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I am myself at my ordinary average of Health, and
beat off the blue Devils with the Ghosts of defunct hopes,
chasing the Jack-o’-lanterns of foolish expectation as well as
I can, in the which, believe me, I derive no small help from
the Faith that in <em>your</em> affection and sincerity I have at least
one entire counterpart of the Thoughts and Feelings with
which I am evermore and most sincerely</p>

<div class="signature">
  <div class="pad15">Your affectionate friend,</div>
  <div><span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge</span>.</div>
  <div class="left">T. Allsop, Esq.</div>
</div>

<p>My kindest love and remembrance to Mrs. Allsop, and
assure her that I called this morning at Mrs. Constable’s, induced
by the very fine though unwarm day, to hope I might
find the little boy there, and was rather disappointed to see
her return without him. But, doubtless, we are entitled
every day to expect a change of the present to a more genial
wind. If the meek little one does not crow and clap his
wings in a week or so from Thursday, it shall not be for
want of being looked after.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_213"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 213. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">April 27th, 1824.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I direct this to your <em>house</em>, or <em>firm</em> should I say? because
I should not think myself justified in exciting in Mrs.
Allsop an alarm, for which I have no more grounds than my
own apprehensions and unlearned conjectures. And yet
having these bodings, I cannot feel quite easy in withholding
them from you. On Saturday, the morning Mrs. Allsop
was here, I was in high hope, the little boy looking so much<a class="pagenum" id="Page_275" title="275"></a>
clearer and livelier than on the Thursday; but the weather
since then being on the whole genial, and the baby showing
no mark of progress, but rather the reverse, and it seeming
to me each returning day to require a stronger effort to
rouse its attention, and the relapse to a dulness, which it is
evident the upright posture alone prevented from being a
doze, becoming more immediate, I cannot repel the boding
that there is either some mesenteric affection, which sometimes
exists in infants without betraying itself by any notable
change in the ingestion or the egesta, yet producing on the
brain an effect similar to that which flatulence, or confined
gas pressing on the nerves of the stomach, will do; or else
that it is a case of chronic (slow) hydrocephalus. Against
this fear I have to say, first, that I have not been able to
detect any insensibility to light in the pupil of its eyes, and
that the little innocent has no convulsive twitches, and
neither starts nor screams in its sleep. For the first I have
no opportunity (the sun being clouded) of making a decisive
experiment, and requested Mrs. Constable to try it with a
candle, as soon as it was taken up after dark; and though
the presence of this symptom is an infallible evidence of the
presence of effusion, or some equivalent cause of pressure,
its absence is no sure proof of the absence of the disease,
though it is a presumption in favour of the <em>degree</em>. The
freedom from perturbation in sleep, however, is altogether a
favourable circumstance, and allows a hope that the continued
heaviness and immediate relapse into slumber on
being placed horizontally may be the effect of weakness. But
then the poor little fellow habitually keeps its hand to its
head, and there is a sensible heat and throbbing at the
temples. On the whole, you should be prepared for the
possible event, and Mrs. Constable is naturally very anxious
on this point, not merely lest any neglect should be suspected
on her part, but likewise from an anticipation of the mother’s
agitation, should she at any time come up just to witness the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_276" title="276"></a>
baby’s last struggles, or to find no more what she was expecting
to see in incipient recovery.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me, my dearest friend, nor let this
letter alarm you beyond what the facts require. I have seen
no decisive marks, no positive change for the worse, no
measurable <em>retro</em>-gression. I have of course repeatedly
spoken to Mr. Gillman, but he says it is impossible to form
any conclusive opinion. There is no proof that it may not
be weakness at present and hitherto, but neither dare he
determine what the continuance of the weakness may not
produce. Nothing can warrantably be attempted in this uncertainty
but mild alteratives, watchful attention to the
infant’s regularity, with as cordial nourishment as can be
given without endangering heat or inflammatory action.</p>

<p>I do not think that I have been able to remain undisturbed
an hour together for the last three days, such a
tumble in of persons with requests or claims on me has
there been. House-hunting, etc., etc.</p>

<p>P.S. To my great surprise and delight, Mr. Anster came in
on us this afternoon, and in perfect health and spirits.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a><a class="pagenum" id="Page_277" title="277"></a></p>

<p class="p2">It was about this time that Coleridge wrote his beautiful
<cite>Youth and Age</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in which occurs the fine designation of
Friendship as “a Sheltering Tree.”</p>

<p class="p2">The following opinion of Coleridge by Mrs. Gillman is
taken from <cite>The Bright Side of Life</cite> by Dr. Prentiss, an
American, who visited Mrs. Gillman in 1842, and will fittingly
close this chapter:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>“In speaking of Coleridge personally and as a member
of her family Mrs. Gillman’s testimony was to this effect:</p>

<p>“‘I do assure you that through all the years he lived
with us, I do not remember once to have seen him fretful
or out of humour; he was the same kindly, affectionate
being from morning till evening, and from January till
December. He delighted to reconcile little differences, and
to make all things go smoothly and happily. He was always
teaching the Beautiful and the Good, while his own daily
life was the best illustration of the good and beautiful which
he taught. You know how the world sometimes misrepresented
and ill-treated him, and he felt it now and then very
keenly; but he bore it all with the sweetest patience. As I
have said, I never saw him in what could be called an ill-temper
during the nineteen years he was under our roof,&mdash;never!
The servants in the house idolized him; and when
he died it seemed as if their hearts would break. We all
had one feeling toward him: we all loved him alike, each in
our own way; and we all alike wept when he died. Love
was the law of his nature. He clothed his friends, to be
sure, in the colours of his own fancy, and sometimes, perhaps,
the colours were too bright; but it was his goodness
of heart, quite as much as his imagination, that was at
fault.’”</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE NEW ACADEME</span></h2>

<p class="p2">[The letters to Allsop gradually lessen in number as we
draw away from the year 1822. This is not necessarily
because there was less communication between the two
friends, but more probably because their meetings were more
frequent. The Gillmans, on account of the large circle of
friends who assembled round their guest, had to set aside
an afternoon once a week as a special “at home” day for
the convenience of visitors (<cite>Life of Alaric Watts</cite>, i, 244&ndash;45).
This was the origin of the <cite>Table Talk</cite>, edited by Henry
Nelson Coleridge, which begins on 29th December 1822,
and continues, with breaks, to the year 1834. Various accounts
have been given of these celebrated Thursdays, the
most notable of which is that of J. Noon Talfourd in the
concluding chapter of his <cite>Final Memorials of Charles Lamb</cite>.
The scraps of <cite>Table Talk</cite>, published by Henry Nelson Coleridge,
though reckoned of great value, are, after all, very
isolated; and to any one who has studied Coleridge’s prose
works and can comprehend the “grand planetary wheelings”
of his logic they appear insufficient to warrant the accounts
of the eulogists of Coleridge’s conversational ability. Doubtless
they have the same relationship to Coleridge’s conversation
as the shattered fragments of the great icebergs which
come floating down the Gulf Stream and wreck themselves
on the coasts of Iceland have to the icebergs of which they
are the disunited parts.</p>

<p>Many men who afterwards attained to eminence in their<a class="pagenum" id="Page_279" title="279"></a>
several departments gathered at the Grove to hear Coleridge
discourse. Charles and Mary Lamb, Basil Montagu and his
wife, J. Hookham Frere, Henry Crabb Robinson, John
Sterling, Henry Nelson Coleridge, Allsop, and Joseph Henry
Green, may be regarded as the planets who revolved around
the central sun. The planets, too, occasionally brought their
satellites. Joseph Henry Green made Coleridge’s acquaintance
in 1817. Deeply interested in philosophy, he imbibed
Coleridge’s principles, and afterwards wrote a book on the
Logos, published in 1865 as <cite>Spiritual Philosophy</cite>. Edward
Irving also sat at the feet of Coleridge; he brought Carlyle
to Highgate in 1824, who wrote his impressions of Coleridge
to his brother the same year, and twenty years later depicted
Coleridge in colours which will remain beside those of Hazlitt,
De Quincey, Noon Talfourd, Henry Nelson Coleridge,
and Clement Carlyon and T. Colley Grattan, one of the fine
gallery of contemporary literary portraits of Coleridge. Dr.
Chalmers came in 1827 and caught occasional glimpses of
meaning, (<cite>Memoir</cite> by Hanna, ii, 126&ndash;27): and Emerson called
in 1833, without, however, any vital feeling of spiritual inter-relationship
springing up between them, (<cite>English Traits</cite>).</p>

<p>During 1824 Coleridge was much engaged with Religious
subjects; and then composed those Letters afterwards published
as <cite>Confessions of an Enquiring Spirit</cite>.</p>

<p>Our next letter refers to the <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite> which
Coleridge was now having published. The germs of the
volume may be found in the long Theological Letter to
Cottle of 1807, in which Coleridge extols Leighton as the
best of the old divines, and in a letter to John Murray of
18th January 1822 (<cite>Letters</cite>, 717) in which he projected a
selection of <cite>Beauties from Leighton</cite>. Its theory of Atonement
also lies in germ in the play of <cite>Osorio</cite>, 1797, (<cite>Remorse</cite>
of 1813). The <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite> not only became the most
popular of Coleridge’s works; it helped to forward interest
in his other writings.]<a class="pagenum" id="Page_280" title="280"></a></p>

<p>The <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite> first appeared in 1825. The original
title was <cite>Aids to Reflection in the formation of a
manly character on the several grounds of Prudence, Morality,
and Religion; illustrated by select passages from our elder
divines, especially from Archbishop Leighton</cite>. In an advertisement
to the first edition, the Author mentions that
the work was proposed and begun as a mere selection
from the writings of Leighton, with a few notes and a biographical
preface by the selector, but underwent a revolution
of plan and object. “It would, indeed,” he adds, “be more
correct to say, that the present volume owed its accidental
origin to the intention of compiling one of a different
description than to speak of it as the same work.” “Still,
however, the selections from Leighton, which will be found
in the fundamental and moral sections of this work, and
which I could retain consistently with its present form and
matter, will, both from the intrinsic excellence and from
the characteristic beauty of the passages, suffice to answer
two prominent purposes of the original plan; that of placing
in a clear light the principle which pervades all Leighton’s
writings&mdash;his sublime view, I mean, of Religion and Morality
as the means of reforming the human soul in the
Divine Image (<em>Idea</em>); and that of exciting an interest in
the works, and an affectionate reverence for the name and
memory of this severely tried and truly primitive Churchman.”</p>

<p>Neither Hume nor Clarendon, I believe, mentions the
persecution of Archbishop Leighton’s father by the Prelatical
party of his day; and yet it was one of their worst
acts, and that which most excited wrath and indignation
against the Primate&mdash;so faithful is their portrait of those
times! Never can I read Mr. Wordsworth’s sublime sonnet
to Laud, especially the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Prejudged by foes determined not to spare,</div>
    <div class="line">An old weak man for vengeance laid aside,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_281" title="281"></a></p>

<p>without thinking of another “old weak man for vengeance
laid aside”&mdash;of Laud in the day of his power pulling off his
hat and thanking God for the inhuman sentence that had
been passed upon the already wasted victim<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;of the miserable
den to which the mangled man was committed for life
after that sentence had been executed in all its multiplication
and precision of barbarity&mdash;then calling to mind the
words of our Saviour, <em>They that take the sword shall perish
with the sword</em>, and <em>Blessed are the merciful for they shall
obtain mercy</em>. It was not <em>mercy</em> alone that was violated by
these acts&mdash;but law and justice; and if he who instigated
and rejoiced in them received neither justice nor mercy in
his turn, is he worthy of the sacred name of <em>Martyr</em>? May
we not say that the <em>vengeance</em> which fell upon this persecutor
was the Lord’s vengeance, even if it came to pass
by evil instruments, and fell upon a head already bowed
down, and in some respects a noble one? Can the <em>glory
and honour</em> of meeting death with firmness,&mdash;nay even with
“sublime” piety, cast its beams backward and bathe in one
pure luminous flood a life darkened with such deep shadows,
as those that chequer the sunshine of Laud’s career?&mdash;the
parts really brightened with the light of heaven? Plainness,
sincerity, integrity, learning, munificence to a cause<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>&mdash;can
virtues like these outweigh or neutralize such faults of head,
heart, and temper, as lie to the charge of this Bishop in the
church of Christ? As well might we set the cold bright
morning dews, that rest on the stony crown of Vesuvius,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_282" title="282"></a>
against the burning lava that bursts from its crater, and
expect them to quench the fire or reduce it to a moderate
heat. <em>Some</em> abatement must be made from the guilt of his
violences from consideration of the <em>times</em>; but to subtract
the whole on that account, or even to make light of it, is
surely too much to make moral good and evil dependent
on circumstance. What? Have Arundel, Bonner, Gardiner
little or nothing to answer for? Was there ever yet a persecutor
that persecuted from mere <em>speculative</em> inhumanity?
Even through Clarendon’s account we may discern, I think,
that Laud’s private passions, in part at least, engaged him
in the cause of Intolerance. He had been exasperated, before
he attained power, by Puritan molestations and oppositions,&mdash;he
became the persecutor of Puritans after he attained
it; as schoolboys that have been tormented while they were
in a low form, torment in their turn when they get into a
high one,&mdash;not their tormentors but unfortunates who represent
them to their imagination. An eminently good and
wise man is above his <em>times</em>, if not in all, yet in many things;
but Laud was the very impersonation of his times&mdash;the
impersonated spirit of his age and his party. (Compare his
over ceremonious consecration of St. Catherine’s Church,
gloated over by Hume, with Archdeacon Hare’s remarks on
his neglect of his diocese, in <cite>The Mission of the Comforter</cite>.)
They who are of that party still, who would still swathe
religion by way of supporting it, and dizen by way of dressing
it, and gaze with fond regretful admiration upon the
giant forms of Spiritual Despotism and Exaggerated Externalism,
as they loom shadowy and magnificent through
the vapoury vista of ages, to them no wonder that he is a
giant too. And there are others, far above that or any other
<em>party</em>, who in their love and zeal for the Church, abstract
the how and the why of Laud’s public warfare, and see him
abstractedly as the Champion of the Church of England.
“God knows my heart,” says Mr. Coleridge, (in a marginal<a class="pagenum" id="Page_283" title="283"></a>
note on Mr. Southey’s article on the <cite>History of Dissenters</cite>,
in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> of October 1813,) “how bitterly I
abhor <em>all</em> intolerance, how deeply I pity the actors when
there is reason to suppose them deluded; but is it not clear
that this theatrical scene of Laud’s death, who was the
victim of almost national indignation, is not to be compared
with ‘bloody sentences’ in the coolness of secure
power? As well might you palliate the horrible atrocities
of the Inquisition, every one of which might be justified on
the same grounds that Southey has here defended Laud, by
detailing the vengeance taken on some of the Inquisitors.”
I do not see that <em>here</em> my honoured Uncle <em>defends</em> the
Primate: he says, “We are not the apologists of Laud; in
some things he was erroneous, in some imprudent, in others
culpable. Evil, which upon the great scale is ever made
conducive to good, produces evil to those by whom it
comes.” And how wise and beautiful is this sentiment a
little further on! “It especially behoves the historian to
inculcate charity, and take part with the oppressed, whoever
may have been the oppressors.”</p>

<p>As some excuse for my Father’s expression, “theatrical
scene,” I allege that sentence of Laud’s; “Never did man
put off mortality with a better courage, nor look upon his
bloody and malicious enemies with more Christian charity.”
My Father adds: “I know well how imprudent and unworldly
these my opinions are. The Dissenters will give
me no thanks, because I prefer and extol the <em>present</em> Church
of England, and the partizans of the Church will calumniate
me, because I condemn particular members, and regret
particular æras, of the <em>former</em> Church of England. Would
that Southey had written the <em>whole</em> of his review in the
spirit of this beautiful page.” (Page 102.) In that very
interesting collection of meditative Sonnets by the late Sir
Aubrey de Vere is one upon Laud, against which I ventured
to write, “If <em>anything</em> done in the name of principle must<a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" title="284"></a>
needs be righteous, then the tortures and long languishing
of Leighton are no impeachment of Laud’s righteousness.”
There was a second edition of the <cite>Aids</cite> in 1831, a fifth in
1843.</p>

<p>The little work <cite>On the Constitution of the Church and
State, according to the Idea of each</cite>, first appeared in 1830,
and went into a second edition in the same year. It is
now joined with the <cite>Lay Sermons</cite> in one volume. To the

<h3><a id="LETTER_214"></a><span class="smcap">[Letter 214. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">March 20th, 1825.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I should have answered your last but for three causes:
first, that I had proofs to correct and a passage of great
nicety to add, neither of which could be deferred without
injustice to the Publishers, and the breach of a definite
promise on my part; second, that I was almost incapacitated
from thinking of and doing anything as it ought to be done
by poor Mrs. G.’s restless and interrogating anxieties, which
in the first instance put the whole working Hive of my
Thoughts in a whirl and a bur; and then, when I see her
care-worn countenance, and reflect on the state of her
health (and it is difficult to say which of the two, ill-health
or habitual anxiety, is more cause and more effect), a sharp
fit of the Heart-ache follows.</p>

<p>But enough of this Subject. I ought to be ashamed of
myself for troubling you with it; you have enough frets and
frictions of your own. And so I proceed to the third cause,
which is that (how far imputable to the mood of mind I was

<p>Is there any definite service, or any chance of any definite

monosyllable <em>Yes</em>, and mention the time. I would have set
off and taken the chance without asking the question, but
that I have so many irons in the fire at this present moment,&mdash;1,
my Preface; 2, my Essay; 3, a Work prepared
for the press by my Hebrew Friend,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> in which I am greatly

<p>Mr. Chance, I take it for granted, has written to you.
My opinion is, that he will be a valuable man, not only
generally, but <em>especially</em> to that which alone concerns <em>me</em>&mdash;<em>your</em>
comfort and happiness. He is a self-satisfied man, but
of the very kindest and best sort. Prosperous in all his
concerns, and with peace in his own conscience and family,
I regard such vainness but as the overflow of humanity. I
do not like him the better <em>for</em> it; but I should not like him
the better <em>without</em> it. Meantime he is active, shrewd, a
thorough man of business; <em>sanguine</em> I should think, both
by constitution and habitual success: and, under any sudden
emergency, I think that Mr. Chance, not so deeply interested,
and yet (such is his nature) with equal liveliness in
feeling, would be a comfort to you.</p>

<p>I shall miss the post if I do more than add, that whatever
really serves <em>you</em>, will (and on his death-pillow quite as
much as in his present garret) delight</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>Having disburdened myself of the main loads of
outward obligation at least that pressed upon me, my Essay
for the R. S. L.,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and my <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite>, with other
matters not so expressly my own, but having the same, if
not greater, demands on such quantity of time, as bodily
pain and disqualification, with unprecludible interruption,
have enabled me to make use of, I take the <em>very</em> first
moment of the Furlough to tell you that I have been perplexed
both by your silence and your absence. In fact, I
had taken for granted you were in Derbyshire, till this
afternoon, when I saw one who had met you yesterday.</p>

<p>Now I cannot recollect anything that can&mdash;I am sure,
ought to have given you offence, unless it were my non-performance
of the request communicated to me by Mr.
Jameson.</p>

<p>I was ever in the <em>stifle</em> of my <em>reflected</em> anxieties, <em>i.e.</em>
anxieties felt by reflection from those of others, and my
<em>Tangle</em> of <em>Things-to-be-done</em>, solicitous to see and talk with
you. You must not feel wounded if, loving you so truly as
I do, and feeling more and more every week that nothing
is worth living for but the consciousness of living aright, I
was <em>nervous</em> if you will, with regard to the effect of this
undertaking on the frame of your moral and intellectual
Being. In the meantime, you never came near me, so that
I might have been able to rectify my opinions, or rather to
form them; and I felt, and still feel, that I would gladly go
into a garret and work from morning to late night, at any<a class="pagenum" id="Page_287" title="287"></a>
work I could get money by, and more than share my pittance
with you and yours, than see you unhappy with twenty
thousand at your command.</p>

<p>Do not, my dearest friend, therefore let my perplexities,
derived in great measure from my unacquaintance with the
facts, and to which my ever-wakeful affection gave the
origin, prevent you from treating, as you were wont to do.</p>

<p>I am sure you did not mean that the interest I feel
in this undertaking was one which I was likely to <em>throw</em> off,
or one which there was any chance of my not retaining; but
I would fain have you not even speak or write below that
line of friendship and mutual implicit reliance, on which
you and I stand. We are in the world, and obliged to

<h3><a id="LETTER_217"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 217. To Allsop</span></h3>

<p class="dateline">May 10th, 1825.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>I have been reflecting earnestly and actively on the
subject of a Metropolitan University, now in agitation, and
could conveniently comprise the results in three Lectures.</p>

<p>On the Histories of Universities generally, the most<a class="pagenum" id="Page_288" title="288"></a>
interesting Features in the History of the most celebrated
Universities in Great Britain, Germany, France, etc. Reduction
of all Universities of any name, with respect to
their construction and constitution, to three Classes. 2. The
Meaning of the Term, University, and the one true and
only adequate Scheme of a University stated and unfolded
from the Seed (<em>i.e.</em> the idea) to the full Tree with all its
Branches. 3. The advantages, moral, intellectual, national,
developed from reason and established by proofs of History;
and, lastly, a plan (and sketch of the <em>means</em>) of
approximating to the Ideal, adapted and applied to this
Metropolis. (N.B. The Plan <em>in detail</em>, salaries only not
mentioned&mdash;the particular sums, I mean.) The obstacles,
the favourable circumstances, the <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> regarding the
question of Collegiate Universities, etc. etc. That I could
make these subjects not only highly interesting but even
entertaining, I have not the least doubt. But would the
subject excite an interest of <em>curiosity</em>? Would the anticipation
of what I might say attract an audience of respectable
smallclothes and petticoats sufficiently large to produce
something more than, with the same exertions of Head
and Hand, I might earn in my Garret (to give the precise
Top-ography of my abode) here at Nemorosi, <em>alias</em> Houses
in the Grove. For the expense of coach-hire, the bodily
fatigue, and (to borrow a phrase from poor Charles Lloyd)
“<em>the hot huddle of indefinite sensations</em>” that hustle my
inward man in the <em>monster</em> city and a Crown and Anchor
Room demand a +, and would an =, after all expenses
paid, but ragged economy, unless I were certain of effecting
more good in this than in a quieter way of industry.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mr. B. Montagu for his advice; but he felt no
interest himself in the subject, and naturally therefore was
doubtful of any number of others feeling any. But he promised
to talk with his friend Mr. Irving about it! On the
other hand, I heard from Mr. Hughes and a Mr. Wilkes (a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_289" title="289"></a>
clever Solicitor-sort of a man who lives in Finsbury-square,
has a great sway with the Slangi yclept the Religious Public,
and, <em>this I add as a whitewasher</em>, was a regular attendant
on <em>my</em> lectures), that the subject itself is stirring up the
Mud-Pool of the Public Mind in London with the vivacity
of a Bottom wind. If you can find time, I wish you would
talk with Jameson about it, and obtain the opinion of as
many as are likely to think aright; and let me know your
own opinion and anticipation above all, and at all events,
and as soon as possible. We dine on Friday with Mr.
Chance. I wish you were with us, for I am sure he would
be glad to see you. Need I say that my thoughts, wishes,
and prayers follow you in all your doings and strivings, for
I am evermore, my dearest friend.</p>

<p>My kindest remembrances to Mrs. Allsop, with kisses for
little Titania Puckinella.</p>

<p><em>Years have passed since I heard the Nightingales sing as
they did this evening</em> in Mr. Robart’s Garden Grounds; <em>so
many, and in such full song, particularly that giddy voluminous
whirl of notes which you never hear but when the
Birds feel the temperature of the air voluptuous</em>.</p>

<p class="p2">P.S. If I undertook these Lectures, I should compose the
three, and write them out with as much care and polish as
if for the Press, though I should probably make no use of
the MS. in speaking, or at all attempt to recollect it. It
would, relatively to my <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</em> addresses, be only a way
of premeditating the subject.</p>

<p class="dateline">(&mdash; 1825.)</p>

<p>My dearest Friend,</p>

<p>The person to whom I alluded in my last is a Mr.
T...,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> who, within the last two or three years, has held
a situation in the Colonial Office, but <em>what</em>, I do not know.
From his age and comparatively recent initiation into the
office, it is probably not a very influensive one; and, on the
other hand, from the rank and character of his friends, he
has occasionally brought up with him to our Thursday evening
<em>conver</em>-, or, to mint a more appropriate term, <em>one</em>-versazione,
it must be a respectable one. Mr. T... is <em>Southey’s friend</em>,
and more than a literary acquaintance to <em>me</em>, only in consequence
of my having had some friendly intercourse with
his uncle during my abode in the north. Of <em>him</em> personally
I know little more than that he is a remarkably handsome
fashionable-looking young man, a little <em>too deep</em> or <em>hollow
mouthed</em> and important in his enunciation, but clever and
well read; and I have no reason to doubt that he would
receive any one whom I had introduced to him as a friend
of mine in whose welfare I felt anxious interest, with kindness
and a disposition to forward his object should it be in
his power.</p>

<p>But again, my dearest Friend, you must allow me to
express my regret that I am acting in the dark, without any
conviction on my mind that your present proceeding is not
the result of wearied and still agitated spirits, an impetus
of despondency, <em>that</em> fever which accompanies exhaustion.
I can too well sympathise with you; and bitterly do I feel
the unluckiness of my being in such a deplorable state
of health just at the time when for your sake I should<a class="pagenum" id="Page_291" title="291"></a>
be most desirous to have the use of all my faculties. May
God bless you, and your little-able but most sincere
friend,</p>

<span class="subtitle">ALARIC WATTS</span></h2>

<p>[While at Highgate, Coleridge contributed some
short pieces of poetry, which may be regarded as
his Autumn Leaves, to the Annals got up by Alaric Alexander
Watts and F. M. Reynolds, to which Sir Walter Scott
and the other leading literary men of the time were induced
to send their less ambitious pieces. Fine steel engravings
accompanied the poems and novelettes; and one of these
by Stoddart, entitled the <cite>Garden of Boccaccio</cite>, was the subject
of a poem by Coleridge in the <cite>Keepsake</cite> of 1829. For
this poem and some trifling epigrams Coleridge received
the sum of £50 (<cite>Life of Alaric Watts</cite>, i, 292). The name
of Coleridge must have stood high to command so large a
fee for the things given to the <cite>Keepsake</cite>. The <cite>Lines on
Berengarius</cite> appeared in the <cite>Literary Souvenir</cite> of 1827,
and <cite>Youth and Age</cite> and <cite>Work without Hope</cite> in the <cite>Bijou</cite>
of 1828.</p>

<p>Some conception of the importance of these annuals may
be gathered from stating that the <cite>Literary Souvenir</cite> of
1827, got up by Alaric Watts, sold to the number of 7,712
copies in England, between November and April, and 700
in America of the ordinary edition, and 528 of a large-paper
edition. There were other annuals besides these already
mentioned, called the <cite>Forget-me-Not</cite>, <cite>Friendship’s Offering</cite>,
<cite>The Amulet</cite>, <cite>The Winter’s Wreath</cite>, <cite>The Anniversary</cite>, <cite>The
Gem</cite>, and other kindred publications (<cite>Life of Alaric Watts</cite>,
i, 305).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_293" title="293"></a>The most finished production of Coleridge’s latest period
is <cite>Alice Du Clos</cite>, a ballad of the Romantic Movement.
Much speculation as to the date of its origin has been put
forth, some thinking it belongs to the time when the <cite>Ancient
Mariner</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>, and the <cite>Three Graves</cite> were written,
others placing it between the publication of the last two
Editions of the Collected Poems, 1829&ndash;1834. But in Letter
205 of date 8th October 1822, the quotation of the two
lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">That names but seldom meet with Love,</div>
    <div class="line">And Love wants courage without a name!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>seems to imply that the ballad was then extant. Coleridge,
as we know (see <cite>Letters</cite>, ii, 717), was engaged between 1822
and 1825 writing his <cite>Aids to Reflection</cite>, and the following
curious passage occurs in Aphorism XXXI (Moral and Religious
Aphorisms). Speaking of slander, he says: “It is not
expressible how deep a wound a tongue sharpened to this
work will give, with no noise and a very little word. This is
the true white gunpowder, which the dreaming projectors of
silent mischief and insensible poisons sought for in the
laboratories of art and nature, in a world of good; but
which was to be found in its most destructive form, in <em>the
world of evil</em>, the Tongue” (Bohn Library edition, p. 70).
<cite>Alice Du Clos, or the Forked Tongue</cite>, is the full title of the
ballad; and it looks as if it had been written to illustrate
the passage, though it has an affinity with Lewis’s <cite>Ellen of
Eglantine</cite> and <cite>The Troubadour, or Lady Alice’s Bower</cite>
(<cite>Tales of Terror and Wonder</cite>).<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to William Blackwood of 20th October 1829
Coleridge says he has among other poems for the Magazine,
“a Lyrical Tale, 250 lines,” which he could give if desired<a class="pagenum" id="Page_294" title="294"></a>
(<cite>William Blackwood and his Sons</cite>, by Mrs. Oliphant, i, 415).
The date of the poem may therefore be put down as 1822&ndash;1829.</p>

<p><cite>Alice Du Clos</cite> ranks with the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>,
<cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, <cite>Love</cite> and the <cite>Ballad of the Dark Ladye</cite>,
among Coleridge’s poems in which he rises out of his own
subjectivity into the clear realm of objective art. The remark
of Thomas Ashe (Preface to the Aldine Edition of the
<cite>Poems</cite>, cxxxvi), that “the great fault of Coleridge is that he
puts too much of himself, <em>unidealized</em>, into his verses,” is
perfectly true. Coleridge was himself aware of this defect, and
in Letter 167, speaking of the <cite>Hymn before Sunrise</cite>, he admits
that there is in the Hymn too much of the <em>idiosyncratic</em>
for true poetry, a piece of self-criticism that can be alleged
against a great number of his poems, beautiful of their kind
yet savouring too often of the Ego. The <cite>Lime Tree Bower</cite>,
<cite>Dejection, an Ode</cite>, the <cite>Lines to Wordsworth</cite>, the <cite>Pains of
Sleep</cite>, the <cite>Tombless Epitaph</cite>, <cite>Youth and Age</cite>, the <cite>Garden of
Boccaccio</cite>, <cite>Work without Hope</cite>, are not exceptions. It is only
in the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, <cite>Christabel</cite>, <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, <cite>The Three
Graves</cite>, <cite>Love</cite>, <cite>The Ballad of the Dark Ladye</cite>, and <cite>Alice Du
Clos</cite>, that Coleridge succeeds in hiding his own personal
identity behind his melodious utterance, and attains to that
simplicity which is truly classical. Most of his other poems
are autobiographical, and can be thoroughly understood
only as part of his epistolary correspondence. His finest
ode, <cite>Dejection</cite>, is only a versified letter to Wordsworth,
afterwards denuded of its most personal references, and
addressed to a “Lady,” to give it a more artistic cast.</p>

<p>The relationship between Coleridge and Alaric Watts
was not confined to the contributions to the Annuals. An
agreeable social intimacy sprang up between the Highgate
household and the Watts; and a correspondence between
Mr. and Mrs. Watts and Coleridge took place. Five fine
letters by Coleridge are contained in the <cite>Life of Alaric<a class="pagenum" id="Page_295" title="295"></a>
Watts</cite>, from which it seems Coleridge and Mr. Watts
intended to collaborate in the issue of an edition of Shakespeare,
which would have been a congenial task to Coleridge,
and one can feel regret that it was not carried out.
A feature of the edition was to be “properly critical notes,
prefaces, and analyses, comprising the results of five and
twenty years’ study: the object being to ascertain and distinguish
what Shakespeare possessed in common with other
great men of his age, or differing only in degree, and what was
his, peculiar to himself” (<cite>Life of Alaric Watts</cite>, i, 243). This,
of course, as any one acquainted with Coleridge’s Lectures
on Shakespeare knows, was one of Coleridge’s favourite
topics, and one which could have been better illustrated in
an annotated edition than in popular lectures.</p>

<p>In one of his letters to Alaric Watts Coleridge gives the
best account of the lack of voluntary power to open letters
sent him; and counsels Watts if he wishes an immediate
answer to his letters to send them under cover to Mrs.
Gillman, who is his “outward conscience.” In another
letter, sending contributions for the Annual, he encloses
his poem entitled <cite>Limbo</cite>, which he says is a pretended
fragment of the poet Lee.]</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE RHINE TOUR, AND LAST COLLECTED
EDITIONS OF THE POEMS</span></h2>

<p>[Coleridge and Wordsworth, who, as we have seen,
had had a serious estrangement in 1810, but gradually
drew together again with the softening of the years,
went on tour to the Rhine in 1828; and this was Coleridge’s
third time on the Continent. On their way they
met Thomas Colley Grattan, novelist and miscellaneous
writer. He gave in his <cite>Beaten Paths</cite> some account of the
two poets as they appeared at the time&mdash;partly reproduced
in Knight’s <cite>Life of Wordsworth</cite>. This passage is the best
description of the two poets in their later period and the
most reliable, along with Clement Carlyon’s description of
Coleridge in Germany. There is no attempt in Grattan to
spin rhetoric out of Coleridge, such as we find in De
Quincey, Hazlitt, and Carlyle. Another diarist gave a
picture of the poets during the Rhine Tour, Julian Charles
Young, who wrote the memoir of his brother, Charles
Mayne Young, an actor of the time. This account is also
partly reproduced in Knight’s <cite>Life of Wordsworth</cite>. Grattan
says: “He was about five feet five<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> inches in height, of a
full and lazy appearance but not actually stout. He was
dressed in black, and wore short breeches, buttoned and
tied at the knees, and black silk stockings. And in his
costume (the same that he describes to have been worn in his
earliest voyages and travels in the year 1798), he worked<a class="pagenum" id="Page_297" title="297"></a>
along, in public coaches or barges, giving the idea of his
original profession, an itinerant preacher. His face was
extremely handsome, its expression placid and benevolent.
His mouth was particularly pleasing, and his grey eyes,
neither large nor prominent, were full of intelligent softness.
His hair, of which he had plenty, was entirely white.
His forehead and cheeks were unfurrowed and the latter
showed a healthy bloom” (<cite>Beaten Paths</cite>, ii, 108&ndash;109). On
all topics touched by Coleridge he said something to be
remembered. “In almost everything that fell from Coleridge
there was a dash of deep philosophy&mdash;even in the outpourings
of his egotism&mdash;touches not to be given without the
whole of what they illustrated” (<cite>Beaten Paths</cite>, ii, 113).
“Coleridge took evident delight in rural scenes. He was
in ecstasies at a group of haymakers in a field we passed.
He said the little girls, standing with their rakes, the
handles resting on the ground, ‘looked like little saints.’
Half-a-dozen dust-covered children going by the roadside,
with a garland of roses raised above their heads, threw him
into raptures” (<cite>Beaten Paths</cite>, ii, 115).</p>

<p>Coleridge made a new collection of his Poems in 1828,
which added to the Early Poems and <cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite> seventeen
new pieces. The collection was published in three
volumes by Pickering, and included <cite>Remorse</cite>, <cite>Zapolya</cite>, and
<cite>Wallenstein</cite>. Coleridge made many careful revisions; his
corrections are a study in verse making. Another edition
was issued in 1829; and here again Coleridge made alterations
in twenty-one of the poems, the chief of which were
in the <cite>Monody on the Death of Chatterton</cite>. The last edition
of Coleridge’s Poems prepared during his life was that of
1834, in three volumes, but though the first volume was
out in May, the third volume was not issued from the press
till after his demise on 25th July. The corrections extend
to twenty-three poems. Some are merely restorations of
former readings; but they constitute a real difference from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_298" title="298"></a>
the text of 1829, and must be accepted as belonging to the
Textus Receptus. Henry Nelson Coleridge superintended
the edition, but it is not likely, as Dykes Campbell supposed,
that he made the alterations, for Coleridge was continually
readjusting his texts.</p>

<p>The remainder of Coleridge’s life from 1829 was taken
up with visits from his old friends, in composing a Commentary
on the New Testament, writing marginalia on the
English Divines, and holding his Thursday at-homes. In
1830 he published his noble pamphlet <cite>On the Constitution
of Church and State</cite>. Many new friends flocked round the
ageing poet, to be introduced to whose acquaintance was
one of the highest literary treats of London life. Friendship
had been the balm of Coleridge’s life; he had had his
estrangements and misunderstandings. But he knew well
that</p>

<p class="center">Friendship is a Sheltering Tree,</p>

<p>the pathos of which line can be appreciated only when we
recall to mind that its writer had been denied the full enjoyment
of the deeper friendship called Love.</p>

<p>A good sized volume could be compiled of all the contemporary
accounts of Coleridge. We have already had
some of these. Another we must add by a young American.
Coleridge was highly appreciated on the other side of the
Atlantic; his monument in Westminster Abbey was the gift
of an American; and the late Emperor of Brazil was an
admirer and student of Coleridge. The following account is
taken from <cite>The Nation</cite>, an American literary journal, of
14th July 1910:</p>

<p>“Henry Blake McLellan was born at Maidstone, Essex
County, Vt., September 16, 1810. He was the son of Isaac
and Eliza McLellan of Boston, and the grandson of Gen.
William Hull of Newton, Mass. After a preparatory course
at the Boston Latin School, McLellan entered Harvard<a class="pagenum" id="Page_299" title="299"></a>
University in 1825, and graduated in 1829. He studied
for the ministry at Andover, 1829&ndash;31, and then went on a
tour, which included Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
and Switzerland. He left America September 16, 1831;
started on his return April 18, 1833, and landed at Boston
June 12. Then came the tragic ending to a bright young
life. Eight weeks after his return he was stricken by typhus,
and died four weeks later, in his twenty-third year.</p>

<p>“Such was the young and ardent spirit who went to see
Coleridge in the filial spirit in which a disciple might have
sat at the feet of an ancient philosopher. He writes this
simple and affecting account of the interview:</p>

<p class="dateline">“‘Saturday, April 27th, 1832.</p>

<p>“‘Walked to Highgate to call on Mr. Coleridge. I was
ushered into the parlor while the girl carried up my letter
to his room. She presently returned, and observed that her
master was very poorly, but would be happy to see me, if I
would walk up to his room, which I gladly did. He is short
in stature, and appeared to be careless in his dress. I was
impressed with the strength of his expression, his venerable
locks of white, and his trembling frame. He remarked that
he had for some time past suffered much bodily anguish.
For many months (thirteen) seventeen hours each day had
he walked up and down his chamber. I inquired whether
his mental powers were affected by such intense suffering;
“Not at all,” said he. “My body and head appear to
hold no connexion; the pain of my body, blessed be
God, never reaches my mind.” After some further conversation,
and some inquiries respecting Dr. Chalmers, he
remarked, “The Doctor must have suffered exceedingly at
the strange conduct of our once dear brother laborer in
Christ, Rev. Mr. Irving. Never can I describe how much
it has wrung my bosom. I had watched with astonishment<a class="pagenum" id="Page_300" title="300"></a>
and admiration the wonderful and rapid development of his
powers. Never was such unexampled advance in intellect
as between his first and second volume of sermons, the
first full of Gallicisms and Scottisms, and all other cisms,
the second discovering all the elegance and power of the
best writers of the Elizabethan age. And then so sudden
a fall, when his mighty energies made him so terrible to
sinners.” Of the mind of the celebrated Puffendorf he said,
“his mind is like some mighty volcano, red with flame, and
dark with tossing clouds of smoke, through which the lightnings
play and glare most awfully.” Speaking of the state
of the different classes of England, he remarked, “We are
in a dreadful state. Care, like a foul hag, sits on us all;
one class presses with iron foot upon the wounded heads
beneath, and all struggle for a worthless supremacy, and
all to rise to it move shackled by their expenses; happy,
happy are you to hold your birthright in a country where
things are different; you, at least at present, are in a transition
state; God grant it may ever be so! Sir, things have
come to a dreadful pass with us; we need most deeply a
reform, but I fear not the horrid reform which we shall
have. Things must alter; the upper classes of England
have made the lower persons <em>things</em>; the people in breaking
from this unnatural state will break from duties also.”</p>

<p>“‘He spoke of Mr. Allston with great affection and high
encomium; he thought him in imagination and color almost
unrivalled (pp. 230&ndash;232).’”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The letters of Coleridge written during his last years
breathe a pious and tender melancholy, but they are few,
and what have been published are fragmentary. On 18th<a class="pagenum" id="Page_301" title="301"></a>
March 1833 he wrote to John Sterling, who, in spite of
Carlyle’s assertion to the contrary, remained a disciple to
the end: “With grief I tell you I have been, and now am,
worse, far worse than when you left me. God have mercy
on me, and not withdraw the influence of His Spirit
from me!” Recommending Mr. Gillman’s son for the Living
of Leiston he wrote:</p>

<p>“I have known the Rev<sup>d</sup> James Gillman from his Childhood,
as having been from that time to this a trusted Inmate
of the Household of his dear and exemplary Parents. I
have followed his progress at weekly Intervals from his
entrance into the Merchants’ Taylors’ School, and traced
his continued improvements under the excellent Mr. Bellamy
to his Removal, as Head Scholar, to St. John’s College;
and during his academic Career his Vacations were in the
main passed under my eye.</p>

<p>“I was myself educated for the Church at Christ’s Hospital,
and sent from that honoured and unique Institution to
Jesus College, Cambridge, under the tutorage and discipline
of the Rev<sup>d</sup>το αἰσθητικόν James Bowyer who has left an honoured name
in the Church for the zeal and ability with which he formed
and trained his Orphan Pupils to the Sacred Ministry, as
Scholars, as Readers, as Preachers, and as sound Interpreters
of the Word. May I add that I was the Junior
Schoolfellow in the next place, the Protegé, and the Friend
of the late venerated D<sup>r</sup> Middleton, the first Bishop of
Calcutta. And assuredly whatever under such Training and
such Influence I learnt, or thro’ a long life mainly devoted
to Scriptural, Theological and Ecclesiastical Studies, I have
been permitted to attain, I have been anxious to communicate
to the Son of my dearest Friends, with little less
than paternal Solicitude. And at all events I dare attest,
that the Rev<sup>d</sup> James Gillman is pure and blameless in
morals and unexceptionable in manners, equally impressed
with the importance of the Pastoral Duties as of the Labours<a class="pagenum" id="Page_302" title="302"></a>
of the Desk and the Pulpit: and that his mind is made up
to preach the <em>whole</em> truth in Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Coleridge was always a lover of children. From his
earliest years he was interested in the weak and small things
of the earth, or as he expressed it at the conclusion of his
immortal poem,</p>

<p class="center">All things both great and small,</p>

<p>which embraced more than the babes; and there is an
innate connection between his solicitude for children and
that sentimental love of the “bird and beast” which characterized
his poetical period (<cite>Brandl</cite>, p. 102). We have seen
how he took notice of the young haymakers on the Rhine
Tour, and how he loved to call the children of his friends by
endearing pet names, Puckinella and the like. The last
letter Coleridge wrote was to a child, not yet able to read,
to whom he had stood godfather.</p>


<h3><a id="LETTER_219"></a><span class="smcap">Letter 219. To Adam Steinmetz Kennard</span></h3>

<p>To Adam Steinmetz Kennard,</p>

<p>My dear godchild,&mdash;I offer up the same fervent prayer
for you now, as I did kneeling before the altar, when you were
baptized into Christ, and solemnly received as a living member
of his spiritual body, the church. Years must pass before you
will be able to read with an understanding heart what I
now write. But I trust that the all-gracious God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, who, by
his only-begotten Son, (all mercies in one sovereign mercy!)
has redeemed you from evil ground, and willed you to be
born out of darkness, but into light; out of death, but into
life; out of sin, but into righteousness; even into “the Lord<a class="pagenum" id="Page_303" title="303"></a>
our righteousness;” I trust that he will graciously hear the
prayers of your dear parents, and be with you as the spirit
of health and growth, in body and in mind. My dear godchild,
you received from Christ’s minister, at the baptismal
font, as your Christian name, the name of a most dear
friend of your father’s, and who was to me even as a son,
the late Adam Steinmetz, whose fervent aspirations, and
paramount aim, even from early youth, was to be a Christian
in thought, word, and deed; in will, mind, and affections.
I too, your godfather, have known what the enjoyment and
advantages of this life are, and what the more refined
pleasures which learning and intellectual power can give; I
now, on the eve of my departure, declare to you, and
earnestly pray that you may hereafter live and act on the
conviction, that health is a great blessing; competence,
obtained by honourable industry, a great blessing; and a
great blessing it is, to have kind, faithful, and loving friends
and relatives; but that the greatest of all blessings, as it is
the most ennobling of all privileges, is to be indeed a
Christian. But I have been likewise, through a large portion
of my later life, a sufferer, sorely affected with bodily
pains, languor, and manifold infirmities, and for the last
three or four years have, with few and brief intervals, been
confined to a sick room, and at this moment, in great weakness
and heaviness, write from a sick bed, hopeless of
recovery, yet without prospect of a speedy removal. And
I thus, on the brink of the grave, solemnly bear witness to
you, that the Almighty Redeemer, most gracious in his
promises to them that truly seek him, is faithful to perform
what he has promised; and has reserved, under all pains
and infirmities, the peace that passeth all understanding,
with the supporting assurance of a reconciled God, who
will not withdraw his spirit from me in the conflict, and in
his own time will deliver me from the evil one. O my dear
godchild! eminently blessed are they who begin <em>early</em> to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_304" title="304"></a>
seek, fear, and love, their God, trusting wholly in the
righteousness and mediation of their Lord, Redeemer,
Saviour, and everlasting High Priest, Jesus Christ. Oh,
preserve this as a legacy and bequest from your unseen
godfather and friend.</p>

<span class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>After Mr. Coleridge’s death in July 1834,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> four volumes
of his <cite>Literary Remains</cite> were published by his
late Editor. Vols. I and II appeared in 1836, Vol. III in
1838, Vol. IV in 1839. Vol. I contains <cite>The Fall of Robespierre</cite>
and other poems, and poetical fragments, Notes of
a Course of Lectures delivered in 1818, Marginal Notes on
several books, Fragments of Essays, Mr. C.’s Contributions
to the <cite>Omniana</cite> of Mr. Southey, published in 1812, and
fifty-six other short articles on various subjects. Vol. II
contains more Notes of Lectures on Shakespeare, including
criticism on each of his Plays, with Introductory Matter on
Poetry, the Drama, and the Stage, prefaced by extracts of
letters relating to these Lectures: Notes on Ben Jonson, on
Beaumont and Fletcher, on Fuller, on Sir Thomas Browne,
an Essay on the Prometheus of Æschylus, and other miscellaneous
writings.</p>

<p>Vol. III contains <cite>Formula Fidei de S. Trinitate</cite>, A Nightly
Prayer, Notes on the Book of Common Prayer, on Hooker,
Field, Donne, Henry More, Heinrichs, Hacket, Jeremy
Taylor, The Pilgrim’s Progress, and John Smith, and a
Letter to a Godchild.</p>

<p>Vol. IV contains Notes on Luther, St. Theresa, Bedell,
Baxter, Leighton, Sherlock, Waterland, Shelton, Andrew
Fuller, Whitaker, Oxlee, A Barrister’s Hints, Davison,
Irving, and Noble, and an Essay on Faith. The present<a class="pagenum" id="Page_306" title="306"></a>
edition of the <cite>Literary Remains</cite> is nearly exhausted. In a
fresh edition new matter will be added from marginal
notes, probably in a fifth volume. Archdeacon Hare speaks
of <cite>The Remains</cite> in the Preface to his <cite>Mission of the Comforter</cite>
in a passage which may fitly be produced here.</p>

<p>“Of recent English writers, the one with whose sanction
I have chiefly desired, whenever I could, to strengthen my
opinions, is the great religious philosopher to whom the
mind of our generation in England owes more than to any
other man. My gratitude to him I have endeavoured to
express by dedicating the following Sermons to his memory;
and the offering is so far at least appropriate, in that the
main work of his life was to spiritualize, not only our philosophy,
but our theology, to raise them both above the
empiricism into which they had long been dwindling, and
to set them free from the technical trammels of logical
systems. Whether he is as much studied by the genial
young men of the present day, as he was twenty or thirty
years ago, I have no adequate means of judging; but our
theological literature teems with errors, such as could hardly
have been committed by persons whose minds had been
disciplined by his philosophical method, and had rightly
appropriated his principles. So far too as my observation
has extended, the third and fourth volumes of his <cite>Remains</cite>,
though they were hailed with delight by Arnold on their
first appearance, have not yet produced their proper effect
on the intellect of the age. It may be that the rich store
of profound and beautiful thought contained in them, has
been weighed down, from being mixt with a few opinions
on points of Biblical criticism, likely to be very offensive to
persons who know nothing about the history of the Canon.
Some of these opinions, to which Coleridge himself ascribed
a good deal of importance, seem to me of little worth;
some, to be decidedly erroneous. Philological criticism,
indeed, all matters requiring a laborious and accurate in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_307" title="307"></a>vestigation
of details, were alien from the bent and habits
of his mind; and his exegetical studies, such as they were,
took place at a period when he had little better than the
meagre Rationalism of Eickhorn and Bertholdt to help
him. Of the opinions which he imbibed from them, some
abode with him through life. These, however, along with
everything else that can justly be objected to in the <cite>Remains</cite>,
do not form a twentieth part of the whole, and may
easily be separated from the remainder. Nor do they detract,
in any way, from the sterling sense, the clear and far-sighted
discernment, the power of tracing principles in their
remotest operations, and of referring all things to their first
principles which are manifested in almost every page, and
from which we might learn so much.”</p>

<p>The last posthumous work of Mr. Coleridge, published
September, 1840, is entitled <cite>Confessions of an Inquiring
Spirit</cite>, and consists of seven letters on the Inspiration of
the Scriptures. It should be understood that this work is
intended <em>not to undermine the belief that the Bible is the
Word of God</em>, or in any degree to lessen the deep reverence
with which it is regarded by Christians, but to put that
belief on a better foundation than it commonly rests upon.
“Let it be distinctly understood,” the author says, “that
my arguments and objections apply exclusively to the following
Doctrine or Dogma. To the opinions which individual
divines have advanced in lieu of this doctrine,”&mdash;for
instance, I suppose, the strange fancy that the <em>words</em> of the
Bible are not divinely dictated, that the language is human
and yet exempt, by divine power, from any possible admixture
of human error,&mdash;“my only objection, as far as I
object, is&mdash;that I do not understand them.&mdash;I said that
in the Bible there is more that <em>finds</em> me than I have experienced
in all other books put together; that the words of the
Bible find me at greater depths of my being; and that whatever
finds me brings with it an irresistible evidence of its<a class="pagenum" id="Page_308" title="308"></a>
having proceeded from the Holy Spirit. But the Doctrine
in question requires me to believe, that not only what finds
me, but that all that exists in the sacred volume, which I
am bound to find therein, was not alone inspired by, that
is, composed by men under the actuating influence of the
Holy Spirit, but likewise&mdash;dictated by an infallible intelligence;&mdash;that
the writers, each and all, were divinely informed
as well as inspired.&mdash;&mdash;I can conceive no
softenings here which would not nullify the Doctrine, and
convert it to a cloud for each man’s fancy to shape and
shift at will. And this doctrine, I confess, plants the vineyard
of the word with thorns for me, and places snares in
its pathways.” He proceeds to shew how the doctrine in
question injures the true idea of the spirituality and divinity
of the sacred volume, and directly or indirectly tends to
alienate men from the outward Revelation. A second
edition of this little work will soon be prepared.</p>

<p>The book has been denounced in strange style by some
who do not profess to have read it. These reasoners assume
in the first place that both the tendency and object of it is
to overthrow Christianity&mdash;whereas any one who reads <em>it</em>,
and not merely what a hostile spirit has predetermined to find
in it, cannot fail to perceive that at least the writer’s <em>object</em>
is to guard and exalt the religion of Christ. But, secondly,
forgetting that the book is [not] intended to overthrow
Christianity, they urge that Christianity has done very well
hitherto without such views as it propounds, and that very
great thinkers and good men have lived and died, in the
faith and fear of the Lord, without the knowledge of them;&mdash;as
if the wants of the Church were in all ages exactly alike;
or as if there had not been in all ages clouds over the sunshine
of faith, occasioned by the difficulties which the writer
seeks to remove; or as if it were not true that the more
light men obtain on one side of the region of thought the
more they need on other sides; as if greatness and good<a class="pagenum" id="Page_309" title="309"></a>ness,
in their application to men, were not relative terms,
and the best and wisest of mortals that have appeared upon
earth had ever been free from error and imperfection! I
should think there is hardly a foolish or evil notion on any
subject which might not be screened from attack by such
arguments as these. And, even were they not such mere
weakness, of what force can they be with those, who take
for their motto, as Mr. Coleridge did from first to last:
<em>That all men may know the truth</em> and that <em>the truth may set
them free</em>? Religious truth and religion are identified in
Scripture, or at least represented as one and inseparable;
and how can a man obey the truth or minister to it, except
by setting forth, what, after the widest survey of the subject
which he is capable of taking, <em>he believes to be the truth</em>?</p>

<p>The suggestion that no man should examine such subjects
or call in question prevailing views in religion save one
who starts from a high station of holiness and spiritual
light, can be of little value unless accompanied by a <em>criterion</em>
of holiness, both as to kind and degree, admitted by all
men. <em>Prevailing</em> notions are often utterly erroneous, and
if none might expose what they believe in their hearts to be
wrong and injurious views, till it was proved, even to their
adversaries’ satisfaction, that they were far advanced in true
sanctity, wrong views would be the prevailing ones till the
end of time. Providence works by finer means than enter
into this sort of philosophy, making imperfection minister
to the perfecting of what is good and purifying of what is
evil.</p>

<p>Whether or no the views of St. Jerome and other ancient
Fathers concerning Inspiration are, as has been affirmed,
something far deeper and higher than we, in our inferior
state of spirituality, can conceive, I do not presume to
decide; but yet I would suggest, that high and spiritual
views in general are capable of being set forth in words,
and of gradually raising men up to <em>some</em> apprehension of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_310" title="310"></a>
them. They do not remain a light to lighten the possessor
and mere darkness, or a light that closely resembles a shade,
to the rest of the world. Things that pertain to reason and
the spirit appeal to the rational and spiritual in mankind
at large; they tend to elicit the reason and expand the understandings
of men; deep calleth unto deep; and if the
teaching of Paul and John is now in a wonderful manner
apprehended by peasants and children, who hear the Gospel
habitually, St. Jerome’s notions of Inspiration, if truly divine
and evangelical, would by this time be generally apprehended
by Christians in the same way, and by the wise and learned
would be comprehended more intellectually and systematically.
Whereas, can it be denied, that no consistent scheme
of Inspiration has ever been gathered from the teaching of
those ancient Fathers? They who believe that such a scheme
is contained in their writings, explicitly or implicitly, will do
well to unfold it. Merely to talk about such a thing in a
style of indefinite grandeur is but to conjure up a mist, by
the spell of solemn sounding words, to mock the eyes of
men with a cloud castle for a season&mdash;a very little season
it is during which any such piece of mist-magnificence can
remain undispersed in times like the present, except for
those who had rather gaze on painted vapours than on
realities of a hue to which their eyes are unaccustomed.</p>

<p>I have not been able to obtain any exact account of all
my Father’s courses of lectures, given after his visit to
Germany, but find, from letters and other sources of information
that he lectured in London, before going to
Malta, in 1804; on his return from Malta, in 1807; again
in 1808; in 1811; in 1814, in which year he also lectured
at Bristol; in 1817; and, for the last time, I believe, in
1819. His early lectures at Bristol are mentioned in the
biographical sketch.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_311" title="311"></a></p>

<p>The poetic or imitative art, an ancient critic has observed,
must needs describe persons either better than they are, at
the present time, or worse, as they are exactly. The fact is,
however, that in literary fiction <em>individuals</em> can seldom be
exhibited <em>exactly</em> such as they are, the subtle interminglings
of good and evil, the finely balanced qualities that exist in
the actual characters of men, even those in whom the colours
are deepest and the lines most strongly traced, being <em>too</em> fine
and subtle for dramatic effect. Indeed it is scarcely possible
to present a man as he truly is except in plain narrative;
his mind cannot be properly manifested save in and through
the very events and circumstances which gave utterance to
his individual being and which his peculiar character helped
to mould and produce. When taken out of these and placed
in the alien framework of the novelist or dramatist it becomes
another thing; the representation may convey truth of human
nature in a broad way, and seem <em>drawn to the life</em>, if the
writer have a lively wit, but as a portrait of a particular
person it is often the more a falsehood the more natural it
appears.</p>

<p>To poetic descriptions these remarks do not apply. They
are, for the most part, mere views of a character in its
elevated and poetic aspects&mdash;tributes of admiration to its
beautiful qualities. Such are the fine stanzas, already quoted,
in which the <em>poet</em> Coleridge is described by the great Poet,
his Friend:<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and such are some less known, composed by a
poet of a later generation, who never saw my Father face
to face. Of these the last four will serve for a conclusion
to this sketch. I give them here for the sake of their
poetic truth and the earnest sympathy they manifest with
the studious poet&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Cottle’s Text.</cite>&mdash;Cottle has been severely blamed for tampering
with the text of the letters of Coleridge. The most glaring
changes occur in Letter 32, in which Cottle inserts the names of
Lamb, Wordsworth and Dr. Parr, and in Letter 123, in which he<a class="pagenum" id="Page_322" title="322"></a>
alters his own name for that of Biggs, his partner. His changes
consist mostly of omissions. Letters 99, 114, 117, 122, which are
given in full in T. Litchfield’s <cite>Tom Wedgwood the First Photographer</cite>,
are the principal sufferers from Cottle’s treatment. It
cannot be said that these omissions amount to a serious charge
against Cottle. They were made to avoid bringing in the names
of people still alive or whose near relations might object to their
names figuring in a publication, and also to avoid obtruding Coleridge’s
complaints about his ill-health and his own treatment
into notice. His tampering with the letters of Southey, in which
he makes Southey say what he never wrote, is not, of course,
defensible (see Dykes Campbell’s <cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, p. 204 <em>note</em>).
Cottle’s longest omission is in Letter 99, to Wedgwood, where
Coleridge quotes what Lamb had written to him about Cottle’s
own poem <cite>Alfred</cite> (see Ainger’s <cite>Letters of Lamb</cite>, i, 138). The
omission of such a passage was only to be expected; Cottle was
not going to act as his own hangman. Henry Nelson Coleridge,
Thomas Noon Talfourd, and even Canon Ainger, and indeed
nearly all editors of letters published during the first half of the
nineteenth century, took the liberty to discriminate what should
be communicated to the public in volumes such as Cottle’s.</p>

<p><cite>Vol. I, p. 50.</cite>&mdash;The Summer of 1795 should be “the Autumn
of 1794;” see <cite>Thomas Poole and his Friends</cite>, I, 95.</p>

<p><cite>Vol. I, p. 62.</cite>&mdash;Letter 24 is placed by Cottle in the spring of
1796, but being dated from Stowey, it is possible that this letter
may belong to 1797. The revision of the <cite>Religious Musings</cite>
mentioned in the letter would suit 1797 as well as 1796, for the
text of that poem differed very widely from that of the First

<p class="p2"><cite>Vol. I, p. 292</cite>, <cite>Letter</cite> 117. Books from Wordsworth’s Library.&mdash;“Perhaps
one of the most interesting books in the whole selection
is Sir T. Browne’s <cite>Enquiries into Vulgar and Common
Errors</cite>, the folio edition of 1658, which contains a long letter to
Sara Hutchinson, relative principally to many curious passages
in the work, also several MS. marginal notes and corrections,
all in the handwriting of S. T. Coleridge, and autographs of
Charles Lamb and Mary Wordsworth. The copy of Sir Thomas
Browne’s <cite>Religio Medici</cite>, 1669, contains copious marginal and
other MS. annotations by Coleridge, and has this inscription
inside the cover, ‘Sara Hutchinson from S. T. C.’”&mdash;<cite>Athenæum</cite>,
No. 3579, May 30, 1896.</p>

<p class="p2"><cite>Vol. II, p. 262</cite>, <cite>Contemplative melancholy</cite>.&mdash;The phrase is a
variation of “speculative gloom,” which Coleridge used in his
original prospectus of the <cite>Friend</cite>, objected to by Francis Jeffrey
(see Letters, ii, 536, <em>note</em>), and afterwards changed into “<cite>Dejection
of Mind</cite>” in the printed Prospectus (see Letter 143, vol. ii,
p. 51). The phrase “speculative gloom” was derived from Warton’s
<cite>Ode for the New Year</cite> 1786 (which Coleridge took as his
model for his own <cite>Ode to the Departing Year</cite>):</p>

<p class="p2"><cite>Vol. II, p. 294.</cite> <cite>The Objective and the Subjective in Art.</cite>&mdash;Goethe
and Schiller always insisted upon the <cite>Objective</cite> as the
highest form of art; many passages occur in their letters regarding
the distinction. Schiller says, 28th November 1796:
“As regards <cite>Wallenstein</cite>, it is at present progressing very
slowly, as I am chiefly occupied with the raw material, which
is not yet quite collected; but I still feel equal to it, and I have
obtained many a clear and definite idea in regard to its form.
What I <em>wish</em> and <em>ought</em> to do, and what I <em>have</em> to do, has now
become pretty clear to me; it now merely depends upon accomplishing
what I wish and what I ought to do by using what
I have in hand before me. As regards the <em>spirit</em> in which I am
working, you will probably be satisfied with what I have done.
I shall have no difficulty in keeping my subject outside of myself,
and in only giving the object.”&mdash;<cite>Bohn Library Translation</cite>,

<cite>Religious Musings</cite> was at first called <cite>The Nativity</cite>, and sent to
Charles Lamb in December 1794 as an unfinished poem. Coleridge wrote
to Cottle in one of his short notes, while his first volume of <cite>Poems</cite> was
being put through the press: “<cite>The Nativity</cite> is not quite three hundred
lines. It has cost me much labour in polishing; more than any poem
I ever wrote, and I believe it deserves it:” Cottle’s <cite>Reminiscences</cite>,
p. 66. The first 158 lines, down to “This is the Messiah’s destined
victory!” were probably written in the spring of 1796. Their spirit is
diametrically opposed to the remainder of the poem, in which the
Messiah’s victory is to be a political one.</p>

“He never could write a thing that was immediately required of
him,” says Mr. S., in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, of May, 1838. “The
thought of compulsion disarmed him. I could name other able literary
men in this unfortunate plight.” One of the many grounds of argument
against the sole <em>profession</em> of literature.&mdash;S. C.</p>

[Sir Archibald Alison, after having eulogized Sir Walter Scott,
Byron, Campbell, Southey, and Moore, and indicated their relationship
to the French Revolution, says: “But the genius of these men, great
and immortal as it was, did not arrive at the bottom of things. They
shared in the animation of passing events, and were roused by the
storm which shook the world; but they did not reach the secret caves
whence the whirlwind issued, nor perceive what spirit had let loose
the tempest upon the earth. In the bosom of retirement, in the recesses
of solitary thought, the awful source was discovered, and the Aeolus
stood forth revealed in the original Antagonist Power of wickedness.
The thought of Coleridge, even during the whirl of passing events,
discovered their hidden springs, and poured forth in an obscure style,
and to an unheeding age, the great moral truths which were then being
proclaimed in characters of fire to mankind.”&mdash;<cite>History of Europe</cite>, chap.

The passage belongs to him as far as “heart’s deep fervency.” It
concluded, when first written, with a reference to the unhappy thraldom
of his powers, of which I have been speaking; for at that time, says the
writer, in a private communication, “he was not so well regulated in
his habits and labours afterwards.” The verses are from a <cite>Rhymed Plea
for Tolerance</cite>: in two dialogues, by John Kenyon. I wish that I had
space to quote the sweet lines that follow, relating to the author’s own
character and feelings, and his childhood passed “in our Carib isle.”
They do justice to Mr. Kenyon’s humility and cheerfulness, in what
they say of himself, but not to his powers.</p>

The remarks in that article upon my Father’s remarks on <em>poetic
diction</em> I have vainly tried to understand:&mdash;“a paste of rich and honeyed
words, like the candied coat of the auricula, a glittering tissue of quaint
conceits and sparkling metaphors, crusting over the rough stalk of
homely thoughts; &amp;c. such is the style of Pope and Gray; such very
often is that of Shakespeare and Milton; and, notwithstanding Mr.
Coleridge’s decision to the contrary, of Spenser’s <cite>Faëry Queen</cite>.” <cite>Homely</cite>
thoughts clothed in a glittering tissue of poetic diction are but pseudo-poetry;
and the powder on the auricula would be nothing, if the coat
itself were not of velvet. Mr. C.’s decision respecting the <cite>Faëry Queen</cite>
is equally misrepresented, for he maintains that Spenser’s language <em>is</em>
distinct from that of prose, such language being required by his thoughts
and in harmony with them. To say that he decided “the contrary,” as
if he had denied poetic diction to Spenser, is not like the auricula’s
coat, <em>candid</em>.&mdash;S. C.</p>

It is apprehended that this must be a mistake. I sent Mr. Coleridge
five guineas for my Shakspeare ticket, and entertain no doubt but
that some others did the same. But his remark may refer to some succeeding
lectures, of which I have no distinct recollection [Cottle].</p>

This statement requires an explanation, which none now can give.
Was the far larger proportion of this £300 appropriated to the discharge
of Opium debts? This does not seem unlikely, as Mr. C. lived
with friends, and he could contract few other debts [Cottle]. [This note
is most misleading. Coleridge’s receipt for the £300 is dated November
12, 1807 (<cite>De Quincey Memorials.</cite> I, 132). At this time, and for
long after it, Coleridge never lived with friends except the Morgans,
whom he paid. Cottle’s assumption is baseless.]</p>

This is too strong an expression. It was not idleness, it was not

latent disease, of which sufficient proof is given in this memoir.&mdash;[Note

The particulars of this instance of Star Chamber tyranny I read in
Aikman’s <cite>Life of Archbishop Laud</cite>, prefixed to his works. It is said
that when he was taken out of the wretched cell in Newgate in which
he was confined before his sentence, “<em>the skin and hair had almost
wholly come off his body</em>.” This was for writing against <em>Prelacy</em>, not
against Christianity. Any man may do the like now and not a hair of
his head can be touched; yet <em>moral</em> offences, public or private, have far
less chance of escaping with impunity than they had then. [S. C.]</p>

Here seems an allusion to an anti-utilitarian maxim of Bacon’s,
which is very expressive of my Father’s turn of mind:&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tamen

artes, exercere, legere, nos invicem dignoscere possimus, et nihilominus

<h2><a id="endnote"></a>Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>Footnotes and Bracketed Text</strong></p>

<p>The editor of this and its companion volume has used square brackets to
denote added material, including footnotes. The brackets occasionally
are not closed. There are also several footnotes which are either
missing in the text, or missing their numbers on the notes themselves.
These have been corrected, based on the context and usage elsewhere.</p>

<p class="hang"><a href="#Page_168">p. 168</a>. The footnote anchor for note 102 is missing. It
normally would fall at the end of the letter to which it refers, and has
been added there.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>Punctuation</strong></p>

<p>Punctuation is occasionally used inconsistently.  Where these are minor
(especially in the table of contents, footnotes, and the index), they
have been silently corrected.</p>

<p>Letter 151 ends on <a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a> with a closing quote and attribution:</p>

<p class="quote">...of his motive"--Quoted from the _Gentleman's Magazine_ of
    June, 1838.</p>

<p>There is no corresponding opening quote, and one is not added here.</p>

Ellipses are used (pp. 258, 262-263, 290), seemingly to elide a name.
They have been reproduced as found there. There is also the phrase
"when I... took me by surprise" which may well be a mistake for 'J...',
which was used just above. The 'I' has been retained as printed.
<p>Ellipses are used (pp. <a href="#Page_258">258</a>, <a href="#Page_262">262&ndash;263</a>, <a href="#Page_290">290</a>), to elide a name. They
have been rendered as long dashes here.  There is also the phrase “when
I&mdash;&mdash; took me by surprise” which may well be a mistake for ‘J&mdash;&mdash;’,
which was used just above. The ‘I’ has been retained as printed.</p>
